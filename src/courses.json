This question has been addressed by various disciplines, including the fields of &ldquo;Evolutionary Psychology&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sociobiology&rdquo; and &ldquo;Physical Anthropology&rdquo;. The common problem with the construction of the framework of these fields is the chain of untested assumptions underlying the historical ideas in the field, and the development of ideas unmoored to the physiological basis of either evolution or cognition. We will break down each model used to teach Evolutionary Psychology to critically examine each system, and each system feeds into a larger understanding of what is involved in the evolution of cognitive abilities. This course looks at the question of whether there are aspects of behaviour and cognition that do and do not seem to have evolved in particular evolutionary contexts.</p>\n\n<p>The first step in our critical examination is to understand what evolution does and does not mean in a Darwinian framework; as well as whether and how cognition can be defined and accurately assessed. We look at what aspects of behaviour are hardwired, and what is plastic. We understand that evolution pertains to genetic changes, and get a quick understanding of what genetics constitutes. We then learn about epigenetics, gene expression, how the framework of genes and their expression drives physiological development of an embryo, how the brain develops as a subset of the body from a genetic framework, and about the relative ridigity and plasticity of parts of the brain during development and in adulthood. We then visit various questions in evolutionary cognition, focussing on the historical debates between the people who began extending the framework of evolution to understand behaviour and cognition.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The learning goals for this class are to primarily learn how to distinguish an evidence-based understanding of evolutionary cognition from what have been called &ldquo;just-so&rdquo; stories, which clog the public and even scientific realm.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Classes will be structured with lectures interspersed with discussions and student presentations. Students will take responsibility for presenting specific papers and sections of books to the rest of the class. This will be a reading and discussion-heavy course.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The main expectation of students is that they pay full attention in class, alerting the TF or me, through class discussions or by posting on discussion fora&nbsp;if there is anything they do not understand. Piazza posts are encouraged to be public, so that other students can benefit from reading responses to questions asked, although they can certainly be anonymous.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This class will have one assignment and one presentation per student in class, where you can chose a topic to research and critically analyse the literature on the issue and develop your thinking on the question. Students can choose between a presentation and assignment format for their third submission. Each submission, whether assignment or presentation, will count for 30% each of your final grade.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Your participation in class or even by email will count towards the remaining 10%. This means that attendance is in some sense graded. Also note that your participation during presentations carry more weight than participation in other classes. The breakdown of this 10% is: 2% sharing of all presentations and assignments on piazza, 2% attentive listening, 4% attendance, 2% general participation in class or outside class during the semester (note that participation is calculated relative to the maximum participation score).</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Attendance: will be marked as a component of the participation grade.

The theory Course is designed keeping in mind that the students have already acquired a detailed overview of genetics, cell and molecular biology, microbiology and biochemistry. Through these courses you have been introduced to discreet modules of biological phenomena. However, these are all part of one continuum. A cell is an organized state of chemical reactions with well-defined boundary conditions, which facilitate balance between energy vs entropy. The viscosity of the cellular fluid and rate of diffusion/movement of various components in and out cells maintain relative concentrations of biomolecules in time and space.

Nearly every aspect about&nbsp;them is disputed &ndash; from their role in &ldquo;feeding the world&rdquo; and their impacts with respect to yield and environment to regulatory policies and peoples&rsquo; notions of choice and ethics. This course examines the GM debate by looking at the transformations of agriculture and agricultural sciences in the 20th century. It analyzes how private industry has sought profits from agriculture, and the consequent impacts on farming communities. This will help us grasp deeper issues that are often lost in heated anti/pro-GM arguments. Surveying controversies in India, the USA and other parts of the world, the course will demonstrate how the GM debate is shaped by the inter-related shifts in law, politics, and science. By way of examining the case of Bt cotton, Golden Rice, Bt brinjal&nbsp;among others, the course ultimately invites the question: Where do GM crops fit in the landscape of the burning issues faced by the average farmer, if at all?</p>\n\n<p>More broadly, the questions we will consider in this class are, in fact, relevant to most technologies incident upon agriculture, and on the relationship between technology and society, in general. Our learnings from this course will carry over to a larger set of issues than GM crops alone.</p>\n\n<p>This is a&nbsp;seminar course&nbsp;i.e. it is a discussion-oriented course that relies on close reading of research.

We will learn about all rhythms with special emphasis on the 24 hour circadian rhythms. Living organisms adapt to the surrounding environment by coordinating different biological tasks with the 24 h rotation of the earth with the help of a cell-based clock, termed as the circadian clock. Circadian clock generates self-sustaining endogenous rhythms in physiology, behaviour and metabolism that have wide implications in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. This course will give a brief overview of how circadian clocks generate temporal rhythms and their significance in survival and adaptability of the organisms.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sleep</strong><br />\n<br />\nSleep is a brain state we enter into and exit from daily. Further, it is not just us humans who sleep - sleep is near ubiquitous among animals. Yet, sleep remains enigmatic. In this section, we will introduce the neuroscience of sleep. We will begin with a description of sleep phenomenology, go on to discuss the circuits and transmitters that regulate sleep,&nbsp; talk about sleep disorders, and finally consider some ideas about the functions of sleep. We will draw on sleep literature in humans, small mammals, and crucially very many invertebrates that are known to sleep.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><u><strong>Rhythms of Life</strong></u></p>\n\n<p>Understanding the fundamentals and mechanism of temporal rhytms of behaviour, physiology, biochemistry and metabolism from a single celled to multicellular organisms<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Sleep</strong></u><br />\n<br />\nUnderstanding the mechanisms that regulate sleep as well as the functional consequences of sleep for brain and body function.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This course is for UG who have completed&nbsp;Introduction to biology 2 or&nbsp;Introduction to biology 3 OR Biology M.Sc.

A modern biologist can use multiple tools to make sense of data and uncover signals that help describe how the world works. This course is aimed at providing a toolkit to help research students design field and laboratory studies and link data to models (a description of how the world works). The discussion topics include replication and pseudoreplication, randomisation, sample size and degrees of freedom, orthogonal design, and non-orthogonal observational data. The topics on statistical modelling include parameter estimation, model prediction, overfitting, collinearity, missing data, approaches to choosing models, and model simplification. This course will be taught through lectures and worksheets using the R programming language.

Starting with Sir Isaac Newton in the 17th century we will travel up to the middle of the 20th century.

China&rsquo;s sixteenth-century commercial revolution, in the context of the growing international trade in silver, transformed social and cultural life in every corner of society. Since then, arguments about the distribution of resources and the proper remedy for inequality have been central to political and social movements, especially during the twentieth century. In this course we will examine the economic bases of income inequality in Chinese history, investigate strategies Chinese governments and individuals have used to mitigate rural and urban poverty, and come to appreciate how these economic realities affected people at all levels of Chinese society. Wealth and poverty were experienced differently according to factors including (but not limited to) gender, age, level of education, disability, sexuality, ethnicity, and location. We will read primary sources which illuminate a wide range of perspectives and consider, in conversation with the secondary literature, how to synthesise these materials. The written assessment for this class will build towards developing expertise on a single Chinese region or locality.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/72b7aecf-2ee0-4cda-a0a7-e828a3620572.docx' download='CHI3002:HIS3511 Syllabus Wealth and Inequality in China.docx'>CHI3002:HIS3511 Syllabus Wealth and Inequality in China.docx</a></td></tr></table></div></div>"

This course overviews major studies of the historical development of family lineages, its geographic diversity, and their continued existence today as well as their relation to issues of gender, ethnicity, religion, and kinship.<br />\n<br />\nThe first section gives a general overview of Confucian thought with an emphasis on its understanding of kinship and ritual. Section two moves onto historical anthropological studies of the development of family lineages, their related institutional structures (lineage halls) and rituals (ancestor veneration), and their connection to broader social, political, and economic life. Finally, we end the course with ethnographic studies of family lineages in the modern world to consider the impact of the nation-state, urbanization, changes in family dynamics, and transnational communication have had on the lineage.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Section 1: Kinship and Ritual in Confucian Thought and Imperial Power</em></strong><br />\nThis section of the course focuses on Confucian theories of kinship and ritual followed by an overview of the role of these ideas in the structuring of the state and society. The purpose of these theories was different than modern academic works as the aim was to influence how people acted rather than explain what they already were doing. However, they also present an indigenous understanding of these concepts and how the literati elite used them to analyze social issues.<br />\n<br />\n<strong><em>Section 2: Historical Anthropology, Family Lineage, and Local Society</em></strong><br />\nHistorical anthropology emerged in China in response to largely ahistorical orientalist ethnographies of Chinese societies that saw the lineage structure as a monolith and largely drew on existing theories of lineage from European colonies in Africa as well as nationalist histories that presented a unified Chinese culture. In contrast to such studies, historical anthropologists combine fieldwork and local historical documents to analyze the diverse ways that family lineage developed throughout China.

In contrast to such studies, historical anthropologists combine fieldwork and local historical documents to analyze the diverse ways that family lineage developed throughout China.<br />\n<br />\n<em><strong>Section 3: Ethnography, Lineage, and Modernity</strong></em><br />\nThe twentieth century saw the end of dynastic China and with it the bureaucracy staffed by scholar-officials trained in the Confucian tradition. Despite the numerous attacks on traditional culture and the land reform movement that stripped lineages of their land holdings in this period, many lineages throughout China continue to this day. This section focuses on ethnographic studies of how the family lineage has responded to many of the changing social, political, and geographic issues in this period.</p>\n</div></div>"

We will examine Mao&rsquo;s theories and practice of revolution through a thematic lens: not as biographical artifacts but as thought produced by and constitutive of the revolutionary circumstances in the twentieth-century world at large and China in particular.&nbsp; Our aim will be to investigate how three modal terms&mdash;Chinese, Revolutionary, Marxist&mdash;reflect on each other as open questions when Mao Zedong is studied in contextually-embedded and philosophically complex manner.</p>\n\n<p>Situating the world in an intimate dialogic relationship to China, we will ask the questions; was Mao a Marxist? How was Mao&rsquo;s Marxism inflected by his positionality of being Chinese in a revolutionary twentieth-century world? How was Mao&rsquo;s Chineseness influenced by his being a revolutionary in the twentieth-century world? How was Marxism impacted by Mao&rsquo;s articulation of revolution in the twentieth-century world? The readings for this class will mostly be drawn from Mao&rsquo;s own writings, and students will be expected to read these texts intensively, with an open mind. While this course does not require any previous knowledge of China, as an advanced level class, a familiarity with general twentieth-century world history and/or a background in the history of Marxism will be helpful. Students with prior background in neither will be expected to learn on a very steep curve.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Read intertextually and understand literary productions as artefacts of historical and social construction.</p>\n\n<p>Summarize academic monographs in East Asian studies and introduce salient points in&nbsp;notes and in speech.</p>\n\n<p>Be able to draw connections between works to gain an overview of scholarly and historiographical debates.</p>\n\n<p>Be able to trace theoretical or methodological trends across multiple empirical contexts.</p>\n\n<p>Learn the skills of co-writing and co-presenting to gain a sense of how cooperative work can integrate intellectual property as well as collective clarity.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>You are not required to purchase any materials for this course.

That is to say, scrutinizing the beliefs and attitudes that typically go unexamined in a text, drawing attention to the gaps, silences, contradictions, and unspoken impetus that animate written words, but also reading that text through the various registers of its production and circulation&mdash;as an artefact of literary, historical and social conditions that may or may not alter its imagined &ldquo;original&rdquo; context. We are reading Mao, but we will never take him for his word.</p>\n\n<p>I will not take attendance in each class meeting, however, participation in weekly class discussions is a mandatory part of your grade and is necessary for succeeding in the course. If you have circumstances that might affect attendance at a specific class meeting, please let me know ahead of time whenever possible. Flexibility is especially important since Covid is still with us. To protect your privacy, please do not describe any medical situations to me; just inform me that the situation exists and be prepared to provide a doctor&rsquo;s note if requested.</p>\n\n<p>Participation is part of your grade, and should be based on attentive reading, listening, and preparation. Always keep an open mind and be respectful of your classmates and your instructor regardless of what you wish to say, or whether you agree with what has already been said. Being respectful also means that (1) if you have not completed a particular reading, please refrain from commenting on it (2) in the normal course of discussion, if you have just spoken, you should refrain from speaking again until others who wish to contribute have done so (3) contributions to discussion should be based on the readings, lectures, and discussion questions, and should aim to improve our collective understanding of them. In general, please avoid unstructured/unsupported reflections as well as topics that are beyond the scope of the course.</p>\n\n<p>Writing Portfolio</p>\n\n<p>Two-thirds of your final grade for this class will depend on two written pieces that will be thematically related and proceed from each other. The purpose of these pieces is to help you further navigate the landscape of political writing, by interrogating how the processes of (narrative) writing engage with the conveying of &ldquo;information&rdquo; in the quest for coherence, conviction, and accessibility.</p>\n\n<p>The first of these pieces will be a Report on an Investigation of the&nbsp; &lt; &gt; Movement, approx. 5000-6000 words, modeled on Mao&rsquo;s famous Report on the Hunan Peasant Movement. For this first piece, you may choose between reporting on the working conditions of a) campus workers at Ashoka or b) teaching fellows at Ashoka.</p>\n\n<p>The second text is an opinion piece (no longer than 1,000 words) that condenses your longer report into a piece that should function as a call to action. Unlike the first piece, where your stated purpose is an &ldquo;investigation&rdquo;, your purpose in this second piece is to craft an appeal.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that you have the option of writing both the Report and the op-ed as a team project, but that the requirements will change accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>For both pieces, you may choose to conduct interviews in person, speak to campus &ldquo;experts&rdquo;, read theoretical texts or works providing historical background. The methodology is entirely up to you, but you are encouraged discuss your thinking and writing process with me through a series of progress meetings. These meetings will count for ten percent of your final grade.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/9132cd31-e21b-4d9d-b123-10a0f568bf49.docx' download='An Interpretive History of Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Revolution.docx'>An Interpretive History of Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Revolution.docx</a></td></tr></table></div></div>"

Try to keep your presentation to under ten minutes, and use the time to provide a short summary of one or two of the assigned texts, and present to the class your own questions and ideas about the theme through the readings. This exercise will help you condense the readings to their core argument and thereby facilitate review before assignments are due. For this reason, it makes sense to approach every set of readings with a few basic questions: who is the author? What is his or her background? What kind of audience are they addressing? And what is the aim of the text? Is it a purely technical piece of writing or does it raise (or hide?) important political questions? These questions are very basic, but they will help you to structure your contribution to the class. If you would like to additionally discuss reading material or resources not on the reading list in your presentation, please feel free to discuss your ideas for the presentation with me beforehand. Following the week&rsquo;s discussion, the class lead will collate all the notes for the assigned readings, to structure them into an annotated entry for each text we have read.</p>\n\n<p>Carto-paper:</p>\n\n<p>This assignment will be a 5500-6000 word (Times New Roman 12 pt. font, double-spaced, not including footnotes and bibliography) investigation of a single primary source relevant to the field of cartography, broadly construed: this can be a specific map, a surveyor&rsquo;s field diary, an object history of a technical instrument, etc. Feel free to discuss your ideas or adjustments, if you prefer, for this project with me beforehand. You may also turn this into a collaborative project if you wish. Your carto-paper is due 11.59 pm May 14, by email to me. We will be discussing two drafts of your paper as a class. These two drafts are due on Monday 11.59 pm February 20 and April 3, by email. Following your submissions, we will intensively workshop everyone&rsquo;s paper as a group. In these group discussions, you will be expected to have read your peers&rsquo; work (as you would when you will attend conferences, workshops, and panel discussions), and offer constructive feedback to help your peers make progress on their projects. Your participation in these discussions will count towards your final grade for the carto-paper.</p>\n\n<p>These essays are an important way to develop your writing skills&mdash;particularly the formation of a clear and logical argument, the mobilization of evidence, and the quality of prose. Your essays are intended to help you build the specific skill of making a historical argument, and to that end they should be erudite, specific, supportable and argumentative&mdash;not an unstructured reflection, opinion, or summary. They must refer, when needed, to the readings with citations.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Late submissions will not be accepted. If you anticipate that for any reason you will be unable to make these deadlines, please email me at least 48 hours in advance for an extension.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Your essays must aim to illuminate the texts you have chosen to discuss, rather than simply critique them or identify the gaps in the knowledge of the authors. The effectiveness of your arguments will rest on your plausible articulation of positions and paradigms of thinking that you may be unfamiliar or even disagree with. Thus, both your essays and the feedback you offer your peers should attempt to first reconstruct the carefully considered and rigorously formulated thoughts and arguments of the authors you are reading, before seeking to push that comprehension in a new direction.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/536ea63f-1411-4b82-9f68-3464d5362257.docx' download='Borderlands 2023 syllabus and weekly schedule.docx'>Borderlands 2023 syllabus and weekly schedule.docx</a></td></tr></table></div></div>"

Chinese characters are frequently cited as the oldest continuous written tradition, beginning over three thousand years ago, but in that time the physical form of the characters and the materials they were written on have transformed over and over again. We will consider what questions these problems raise for historians&#39; use of textual sources by looking at writing as a social, material, and political act. What were the symbolic meanings attributed to writings that most people could not understand? What practical uses could writing serve? How did access to writing intersect with other social hierarchies, like gender and class? Beginning with the invention of writing in the Yellow River region, we will discuss problems such as: the relationship between speech and writing; changes in writing materials; writing for display and writing for use; censorship; Chinese characters in non-Chinese societies; and debates over script reform.</p>\n\n<p>The written assessment for this class will build towards a final research paper on a topic of the students&#39; choice.</p>\n</div></div>"

Over the last year the process of language spread in this region has become clearer, more consistent with what we know of the Indian languages that have left their traces in the literary record. This course aims to turn previous findings on their head, in a way that will allow students to see with their own instincts how change seems to have happened. Best of all, it falls in line with a new kind of thinking that raises questions about language change in other places, outside India, with the Indian experience getting a chance to shape linguistic theory. This will be a chance to re-think&mdash;and revise&mdash;ideas that came up when we first looked at Indian languages as mixed, and to see how, far from new languages emerging in moments of &lsquo;chaos&rsquo;, the actual process was more orderly than that, and with a different timeline from what we first imagined.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Participation in class and attendance are the main criteria for grading.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>More than 2 unexcused absences will affect the student&rsquo;s grade.</p>\n</div></div>"

The introductory concepts (that we will study in this course) are easy to understand, but are powerful and apply in many contexts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The applications to various fields are too numerous to mention. Lets&nbsp; just say that the modern world would not be so modern without the application of linear algebra, &nbsp;nor would&nbsp;our understanding of the universe would be where it is now.&nbsp;And neither would mathematics be as developed if all kinds of mathematical objects are not studied using linear algebra. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>However, the course is mostly mathematical. Applications will be to understand some mathematical objects.The subject unfolds slowly over the semester.&nbsp;As you work through the semester, you learn how to extend your intuition of&nbsp;two and&nbsp;three dimensions to work in an n-dimensional space. At the same time, as the title of the main textbook reflects,&nbsp; this course may be regarded as an&nbsp;introduction to abstract mathematics. So you learn how to apply logical arguments to prove statements.</p>\n\n<p>Its a busy course requiring a lot of effort and enthusiasm. You have to be young and energetic and want&nbsp;to learn a lot very quickly. But why&nbsp;am I saying this?&nbsp;You are Ashoka students.&nbsp;Of course you are young and energetic and want to learn a lot very quickly!</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The syllabus in the course handbook is as follows.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong>&nbsp;Real&nbsp;vector spaces, subspaces, spanning sets, basis sets, dimension of a vector space.&nbsp; Solution of a system of linear equations.&nbsp;Row space and column space of a matrix, rank of a matrix, elementary row and column operations of a matrix.&nbsp;Inversion of square matrices, rank factorization of a matrix.&nbsp;Properties of determinants.&nbsp;Linear transformations, range and null space of a linear transformation, rank-nullity theorem.&nbsp;Matrix representation of a linear transformation.&nbsp;Inner product spaces, normed linear spaces, examples of different normed linear spaces, orthonormal basis sets.&nbsp;Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, characteristic polynomials.&nbsp;Spectral theorem for real symmetric matrices.&nbsp;Singular value decompositions.</p>\n\n<p>We are likely to do all the above for vector spaces over Complex numbers. The proof of the Spectral theorem is&nbsp;a little easier for this.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Text book:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Isaiah Lankham, Bruno Nachtergaele and Anne Schilling,&nbsp;Linear Algebra - As an Introduction to Abstract Mathematics, Free online text available from:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~anne/linear_algebra/</p>\n\n<p>We will cover most of the book including Appendix A.</p>\n\n<p>The course material is roughly from this book, but I may deviate considerably.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional References.</strong></p>\n\n<p>You may find the following books helpful as supplementary reading in case something is not clear from the textbook.</p>\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;S. H. Friedberg, A. J. Insel and L. E. Spence,&nbsp;Linear algebra, Pearson, 2015. (Good book for extensive explanations, lots of problems for you to make sure you have understood the topics.)</p>\n\n<p>2. P. Bogacki, Linear Algebra, Concepts and Applications, AMS/MAA Textbooks, Vol 47, 2019. (Good for matrix examples.)</p>\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;Gilbert Strang,&nbsp;Linear Algebra and its Applications, (4th or 5th edition). (The classic textbook. Covers a lot. At some point in your career, you should become familiar with it. Lectures are also available for these.)</p>\n\n<p>4. T. Shifrin and M. R. Adams, Linear Algebra: A Geometric Approach, WH Freeman (2nd edition). (Nice book with a geometric flavor. Great for gaining intuition.)</p>\n\n<p>5. Wikipedia is great for mathematics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>6. I will hand out a problem set which includes (most of) Professor Bhatia&#39;s problems from a few years ago.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Computer algebra system.</strong></p>\n\n<p>We will make extensive use of the computer algebra system SAGE. In the real world, Linear Algebra is done using many different numerical packages. However, we use a symbolic algebra package. SAGE&nbsp;is available at:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sagemath.org\">www.sagemath.org</a></p>\n\n<p>Please install it before coming to class. Write to me in case of difficulties. There is a possibility of using it online too, but that has become very slow and irritating. It has to be used as a last resort.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>There will be 10 quizzes (in lecture) (on occasion replaced by&nbsp;Assignments) (33.33% of grade),&nbsp; 2 midterms (in lecture) (33.33%) and a take home final (33.33%).&nbsp; Midterms 1 and 2 are&nbsp; in-class exams.&nbsp;More details will be provided on the first day of class. A max of 2 missed quiz scores can be replaced by average of rest. &nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>While there is no formal requirement to attend lectures and DS sessions, it may be a good idea to do so because we may deviate or add to the material in the textbook which may show up on quizzes and tests. In general, its easier to read the book when you&nbsp;know&nbsp;whats going on in the lectures. Further, there will be no makeup exams (Quizzes or midterms) and these will happen during class times. Usually for math courses expect to spend a minimum of 4-5 hours outside of class every week to keep up.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

Generally&nbsp;speaking, logic is the study of correct reasoning. Informal logic studies correct&nbsp;patterns of inference, in a relatively informal way. Formal logic, on the<br />\nother hand, studies correct patterns of inference, in a relatively formal way.&nbsp; By &ldquo;formal&rdquo;, we just mean the way a mathematician might do it. Symbolic&nbsp;logic is formal logic, where correct patterns of inference are symbolized into&nbsp;an artificial language. This class will cover both informal and formal logic,&nbsp;and so will contain a mixture of symbolic and non-symbolic representations&nbsp;of arguments. The aim is to introduce students to basic logical concepts,&nbsp;different logical systems, various paradoxes and other conundrums central&nbsp;to the development of formal logic, and perhaps most importantly, to learn&nbsp;how to reason better, primarily through learning how to diagram and evaluate&nbsp;arguments, not only those found &ldquo;in the wild&rdquo;, but also one&rsquo;s own&nbsp;arguments. Topics will include: logical notations, diagramming&nbsp;arguments, quantification, formal proofs, paradox, classical logic,&nbsp;modal logic, various non-classical logics, inductive logic, computer logic,&nbsp;metalogic, and some (light) set theory.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

Then, you may use the fact that I am a German to infer that I like Sauerkraut. However, you should not use the fact that Sarah likes Sauerkraut to infer that Sarah is German. Formal logic studies cases like this and provides us with a notion of <em>deductive validity</em> that can explain why the first inference is better than the second. In this course, we will develop this notion, along with a few others, by studying two formal languages called &quot;propositional logic&quot; and &quot;first-order logic&quot;. These languages will allow us to precisely define validity and to check whether a given argument is valid in these languages. Understanding these languages will also be helpful for analyzing spoken languages, and it gives us an insight into computer processing and programming languages as well.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>No prerequisites or required readings.

[ENG-4405/ CW-4405] [ENG-4405/ CW-4405-1]</h4><div><strong>Faculty Name </strong><div class='cmsDescp'>Amit Prakash Chaudhuri [amit.chaudhuri@ashoka.edu.in] ;</div></div><div><strong>Overview</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>For &lsquo;Is There a Modern Indian Literature?&rsquo;, I will use the&nbsp;Picador Book of Modern Indian Literature&nbsp;and a few other texts, and some cinema and music. I also plan to bring&nbsp;in some material from outside India &ndash; the stories of Junichiro Tanizaki, for instance.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question in the course title is one I asked myself as I began putting together the anthology I mention&nbsp;above in the late 1990s. How was one to conceive of a tradition called &#39;Indian literature&#39;? Was&nbsp;it the total of thevarious literatures of India? Or was there another way of exploring this category? It was a time when the Indian novel in English and the idea of &#39;postcolonial literature&#39;&nbsp;had begun to dominate. How did the modernist and avant garde trajectories of literatures in the Indian languages fit into these relatively recent categorisations? One of my own reasons for rethinking and enlarging the frame had to do with my affinities with modernism as a reader and writer, affinities that seemed out of place post-Midnight&#39;s Children, but not so out of place within the experimental histories of<br />\nmodern Indian literatures themselves. The use of the word &#39;modern&#39;&nbsp;was, and is, deliberate, to point to developments that the term &#39;postcolonial&#39;&nbsp;doesn&#39;t address. The texts we&#39;ll read here would&nbsp;follow, without too much narrow systematising, &lsquo;Indian literature&rsquo; and the way its emergence from the late nineteenth century in various languages embodied the trajectory of modernity, modernism, the avant garde, and formal preoccupations in India. The course means to question the largely theme-driven, Anglophone parameters of the &lsquo;postcolonial&rsquo; that have been with us for some decades now.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;As in 2022, this will be a hybrid course, co-hosted by The Oxford Research&nbsp;Centre of the Humanities. Participants will join in from all over&nbsp;the world, but the core class will comprise Ashoka University students, who will take the course in person and will be required to write two essays of 1500 words each over the course of the semester.&#39;&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Students from Oxford and other universities will be sitting in on the class, and will participate in discussions. However, only Ashoka students will be writing essays, for which they&#39;ll be graded.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Grades will be given on the basis of two short essays&nbsp;to be written&nbsp;by each student over the term, plus class contributions. Essays should be shared with the tutor and other students at least four days prior to each class.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>TBA</p>\n</div></div>"

You will engage with a variety of source materials and understand how to ask questions that extend and enrich your understanding -- of situations, texts, institutions and people. You will explore the distinctness of academic research and writing, and participate in an active knowledge community constituted by your peers. By the close of the course, you will have a clearer understanding of what it means to be a scholar in an academic setting, and a keener sense of your own processes of learning, thinking and writing.</p>\n\n<p>The theme this semester is Environmentalism Desi-Style where we read writings by Vandana Shiva, Ram Guha, Amita Baviskar, Mahesh Rangarajan, Nagaraj Adve, Arpitha Kodiveri and others to examine how environmentalism might mean different things for different people in South Asia, and how it has different ramifications in our part of the world than it does in the West.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Most importantly, our classroom will be a safe space for discussion, debate and constructive disagreements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I like my classes to be as interactive and discussive as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If you feel unsure or diffident about speaking up in class, please do not worry; there will be many ways in which I can continue to get a sense of how you feel about various things under discussion, via the weekly blog, other written submissions, and our chats during office hours.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Reading:</p>\n\n<p>1.

Understanding textual context, genre and source material and documenting these via strategic note-making.</p>\n\n<p>Writing&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>1. Developing the craft of outlining, revising, editing</p>\n\n<p>2. Applying form, voice, style, tone to affect writing</p>\n\n<p>3. Developing logical, coherent, structured writing</p>\n\n<p>4. Using explanatory, narrative and justificatory writing</p>\n\n<p>Thinking</p>\n\n<p>1. Practising converting thoughts into words</p>\n\n<p>2. Narrowing down a curiosity or thought into a question</p>\n\n<p>3. Constructing and developing a reasoned argument</p>\n\n<p>4. Engaging meaningfully with multiple perspectives</p>\n\n<p>Speaking-Listening</p>\n\n<p>1. Aiming for confidence, clarity, coherence&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>2. Practising and harnessing audience engagement&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>3. Developing active and respectful listening to others&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>4.

The weightage of the elements, their exact definition, and the decision to add new elements, will be equally divided between the following parameters:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>1. Participation (in classes, office hours&rsquo; meetings, and the weekly blog)</p>\n\n<p>2. Research paper (a longform argumentative paper with citations, written in academic style)</p>\n\n<p>3. Small summative written assignments (including a written quiz at mid-term)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>4. Presentations in class (including a group-based semester-end Debate)</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>For this course, you are allowed three unexcused absences (for which you do not need permission from the instructor) and two excused absences (for which you do need permission from the instructor). The penalty for any absence beyond these five will be decided by the ICT instructor on a case-by-case basis.

It will build on the concepts of statistical inference with the aim to apply them to data and enable understanding of economic relationships. The course will have both a theoretical and an application-based part. The theory will involve understanding the method of least squares estimation and the application part will involve data visualization and analyses using STATA computing software.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The crux of econometrics is to be able to test hypothesis about a population using a sample. We begin by building on our understanding of a population and a sample and the basics of hypothesis testing. The course then moves onto the methods of estimation to understand causal relationships between variables. These methods are not just restricted to economics but are also relevant to the study of political science, sociology and public policy in general. The emphasis will be on inferring causality throughout the course. By the end of this course you should be able to understand and apply the taught econometric methods to test a relevant hypothesis of interest using data, interpret the results and draw appropriate conclusions.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Textbooks and Articles</p>\n\n<p>SJeffrey M.

Having been exposed to ideas and models of macroeconomic growth in Macroeconomics I, this course introduces students to modern macroeconomic theories that seek to explain short-run fluctuations.<br />\nHow do macroeconomists explain short-run macroeconomic fluctuations? And how does this inform macroeconomic policy? This course will provide an in-depth introduction to modern macroeconomic models of business cycles. We will start with some&nbsp;topics on real business cycles. Then the course will then cover the extensions of the model to deal with the shortcomings&nbsp;with respect to labour markets and real dynamics. These extensions will cover various leading macroeconomic theories of labour markets, investment, and consumption. Finally, we will study topics from New Keynesian Economics.&nbsp;The policy implications of these models will be studied throughout.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>By the end of the course, students should have a firm grasp of:<br />\n&bull; Real Business Cycle Models<br />\n&bull; Real Dynamics - Search Models of Labour Markets, Adjustment Cost Models of Investment and Capital Formation, and Consumption.<br />\n&bull; New Keynesian Models</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>&bull; Romer, D., Advanced Macroeconomics (4th Edition or later)<br />\n&bull; Gali, J., Monetary Policy, Inflation and the Business Cycle - An Introduction to the New Keynesian Framework, Princeton University Press<br />\nStudents should have a copy of the textbooks, henceforth referred to as Romer, and Gali respectively. The prescribed readings will be taken from Romer (4th Edition) and Gali (1st Edition). Students with later editions of the textbooks will need to cross-check readings with the earlier editions.<br />\nIn addition to the prescribed textbooks, other textbooks (wherever relevant), and lecture readings&nbsp;from Journal articles will also be provided. Students will be expected to complete these readings as well as those from the textbooks to get a complete grasp of each of the topics.<br />\nA detailed reading list, including textbook references, will be&nbsp;available in the separate Reading List document.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Student grades have the following&nbsp;components:</p>\n\n<p>Exams(2*30%=60%),</p>\n\n<p>Assignments&nbsp;(2*15%&nbsp;= 30%)</p>\n\n<p>Class Attendance and Participation (10%).</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>No strict attendance policy but students are expected to attend all classes.

An average Indian today is 22 times richer than they were in 1960. And yet an average American today is 30 times richer than an average Indian. These differences in the standard of living are even more stark if we expand the set of countries. So to paraphrase the economic historian David Landes: &ldquo;Why are they so rich and we so poor?&rdquo;. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This course will introduce the students to the basics of modern economic growth theory. We will begin the course by formalising the measure of &#39;standard of living&#39;. The discussion of growth theories will start with the seminal model of economic growth, the Solow model. We will then cover topics in endogenous growth theory, the economics of ideas, and technology transfer. This part will highlight the role of&nbsp; R&amp;D and innovation in economic growth. The second part of the course will study some fundamental causes of economic growth such as the role of institutions. Given their ubiquitous nature in the modern world, we will also spend some time trying to understand the relationship between emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), and economic growth. We will end by looking at the relationship between economic growth and exhasutible natural resources.</p>\n\n<p>Students must be comfortable with functions, derivatives, and optimisation, integrals, simple differential equations. Some basic knowledge of regression analysis is also required. So please ensure to brush up these topics before the course.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>What is economic growth? How do economists measure economic growth?</p>\n\n<p>What are the proximate and ultimate causes of economic growth?</p>\n\n<p>Basic knowledge of various economic growth models</p>\n\n<p>How can poorer economies catch up with the richer ones? How does one apply the knowledge obtained through the economic models.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The course will rely on the following as its primary text. I will follow the chapters in this book closely.</p>\n\n<p>Introduction to Economics Growth, Jones and Vollrath, 3 Ed</p>\n\n<p>Another useful reference is the following book</p>\n\n<p>Economic Growth, David Weil, 2 Ed</p>\n\n<p>In addition I will use some journal articles and data sources that I will discuss and covey during classes.&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>25% assignments (total&nbsp;<strong>five&nbsp;</strong>in number)</p>\n\n<p>20% mid-term exam,</p>\n\n<p>40% end-term exam, and</p>\n\n<p>15% class participation</p>\n\n<p>Assignments and exams will be returned to students within two weeks of the submission date. The grading policy is not open to change.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>I like my classes to be lively! Therefore we will work with the following attendance policy.</p>\n\n<p>The course has a 15% class participation component out of which 5% will be awarded on the basis of attendance in class. Grades for attendance will not be linear. You will lose 0.5% of the grade for every class you miss for the first five classes. Absence beyond that will mean you lose the entire grade for attendance.</p>\n\n<p>The rest of the 10% class participation grade will be based on regular participation in class as well as special in-class discussion sessions (15 - 20 mins each)&nbsp;that we will have about 3 - 4 times during the semester.</p>\n</div></div>"

The course will focus on evidence related to caste and sex in India.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The first part of the course will take students through theories of discrimination such as statistical discrimination and taste for discrimination, based on the work of Kenneth Arrow, Gary Becker and George Akerlof.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will lead to a discussion of the overlap between economics of discrimination and related sub-disciplines that are relatively new but are rapidly expanding, viz., &ldquo;Identity Economics&rdquo;, pioneered by George Akerlof and Rachel Kranton, &ldquo;Feminist Economics&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Stratification Economics&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The second section will introduce students to concepts in social psychology such as stereotype threat and implicit bias that produce discriminatory outcomes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The third part of the course introduces students to some of the key methods of empirically gauging discrimination in market settings. This section would familiarize students with decomposition analyses applied to the labour market (what part of the wage gap between two groups is due to differences in abilities, and what part is due to discrimination), using standard techniques from Labour Economics. We would also discuss experimental methods &ndash; both field-based as well as lab-based experiments to gauge discrimination outside the labour market (e.g. housing market), or in the field of charitable giving, or even in labour markets but during the job search process (before applicants find jobs).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Students will be familiarized with literature that applies these methods in the Indian context, particularly to the study of caste and gender discrimination.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The final part of the course will deal with policy options to deal with group-based disparities and discrimination, with a focus on affirmative action policies. This section will outline the various types of affirmative action, including quotas or reservation, and discuss debates around affirmative action, focusing on evidence-based research gauging its impact.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Note: This reading list could see minor changes during the semester which will be announced well ahead of time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does social identity shape economic outcomes?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Akerlof, George. 1984. &ldquo;The economics of caste and of the rat race and other woeful tales&rdquo;, in&nbsp;An Economic Theorist&rsquo;s Book of Tales, Cambridge University Press, 1984, models of statistical discrimination and the caste economy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Becker, Gary. 1957.&nbsp;The Economics of Discrimination,&nbsp;Chs. 1, 2 and 10</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Akerlof, George A. and Rachel Kranton. 2010.&nbsp;Identity Economics: how our identities shape our work, wages and well-being, Princeton University Press, Chs. 1-4</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Darity, William Jr., Darrick Hamilton, Patrick Mason et al 2017: &ldquo;Stratification Economics: A general theory of Intergroup Inequality&rdquo;, in&nbsp;Hidden Rules of Race(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320335744_Stratification_Economics_A_General_Theory_of_Intergroup_Inequality)</p>\n\n<p>Survey article: Onuchic, Paula. 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent Contribution to Theories of Discrimination, mimeo</p>\n\n<p>II.&nbsp;Stereotype Threat and Implicit Bias</p>\n\n<p>Steele, C.

When using time series data for forecasting, the Ordinary Least Square Method is often&nbsp;incorrect due to violations of the Gauss-Markov assumptions. The nature of these violations is described in this course, to introduce methods for rectification. To ensure that the standard asymptotic analysis is accurate, we address constraints that limit the temporal correlation in a time series as we can no longer assume random sampling. Most macroeconomic models are multivariate, which permits feedback between the models&#39; variables. Therefore, in this course, the study of univariate and multivariate processes for forecasting is given equal weight. This course gives emphasis&nbsp;on solving computer exercises.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Empirical exercises will involve applications from the fields of macroeconomics and financial derivatives.

Even in Grammarly&#39;s editorial&nbsp;suggestions as I type this description up!</p>\n\n<p>What will the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) on our economy and society be? Technology giants like Amazon, today have hundreds of economists working for them. What is it that these economists do? These are some of the questions that this course will try to answer.</p>\n\n<p>We will begin the course by understanding what technology and innovation mean to an economist and why are they important. We will discuss how digital technologies reduce transaction and search costs and bring about significant&nbsp;changes in business organisation. Then the students will be given basic knowledge of platform economics. Platforms form the basis of industrial organisation in the digital economy. Next we sill study&nbsp;the economics of automation and&nbsp;technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI). In doing so we will also focus on aspects of the data and digital economy including privacy and data protection. This understanding will then be used to study the effect of such technologies on a range of topics such as employment and the future of jobs, economic growth, organisation of businesses, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The students should have completed courses in microeconomics, game theory, and growth theory. Knowledge of differential calculus and the basics of integration will also be required. Some knowledge of regression analysis will be useful.

This course starts with a micro-founded approach to money using an overlapping generations model and discusses why money is not a constraint but an instrument that arises endogenously leading to welfare gains for the economy. This course further discusses why money is welfare improving vis-a-vis barter or credit, why&nbsp;fiat money is Pareto superior to commodity money, and what causes&nbsp;inflation. Then we go on to study the relationship between money and other institutions that issue/ use money - financial intermediation &amp; banks, a model of bank risk and bank panic (Diamond-Dybvig model).

This section would familiarize students with decomposition analyses applied to the labour market (what part of the wage gap between two groups is due to differences in abilities, and what part is due to discrimination), using standard techniques from Labour Economics. We would also discuss experimental methods &ndash; both field-based as well as lab-based experiments to gauge discrimination outside the labour market (e.g. housing market), or in the field of charitable giving, or even in labour markets but during the job search process (before applicants find jobs).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Students will be familiarized with literature that applies these methods in the Indian context, particularly to the study of caste and gender discrimination.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The final part of the course will deal with policy options to deal with group-based disparities and discrimination, with a focus on affirmative action policies.

This is primarily a course on theory to explain the real world. We keep an eye on broad stylized facts (and occasionally an empirical study). We will consider policy issues. The course is useful for students aspiring to be academics, policy makers, and practitioners (in alphabetical order). The syllabus includes some behavioural finance. It also includes a bit on economics of homes as an asset. Since the financial system is usually classified into two parts viz., financial markets and financial intermediaries, the syllabus is, broadly speaking, in two parts (though these are not always mutually exclusive).<br />\n1. Asset markets, and possible excess volatility<br />\nFormal CAPM model and evidence, stochastic discount factor, efficient markets theory and behavioural finance, limits to arbitrage, stabilizing speculation and destabilizing speculation, asset price bubbles - rational and irrational, debt and asset prices, leverage cycle, balance sheet recession, dynamic hedging, risk aversion and risk appetite, neglected risks, diagnostic expectations (and adaptive and rational expectations), and agency cost (including the dual agency cost perspective).<br />\n2. Financial intermediaries, and instability<br />\nRationale for demand deposits, liquidity (many different meanings), banking crises (different from currency crisis, fiscal crisis, and asset price crashes), bank runs (sunspots and fundamentals-based, inefficient and efficient, partial and complete), non-performing loans, &lsquo;sudden stop&rsquo; and banks, fluctuations in interest rates, &lsquo;peculiar&rsquo; case of stable and efficient Canadian banking, deposit insurance, lender of last resort, credit lines, capital adequacy.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Readings, in alphabetical order<br />\n&bull; Allen, Franklin, and Douglas Gale (ed.), 2008, Financial Crises, An Elgar Reference Col- lection, Chapter 20.<br />\n&bull; Campbell, John Y., 2018, Financial decisions and Markets - A course in Asset Pricing, Princeton University Press, New Jersey (sections 4.1.1 - 4.1.4, and section 5.2).<br />\n&bull; Diamond, Douglas W., and Raghuram G.

From academics to public policy practitioners, to non-profit organizations all increasingly rely on data science techniques for cleaning and gathering data, conducting data analysis, and presenting the results. For example, multiple datasets often need to be transformed, aggregated, and merged before a more comprehensive analysis can be carried out.&nbsp; Researchers might need to create datasets from scratch by converting a large number of PDFs into machine-readable texts or scraping data from a website or interacting with an API. These tasks require knowing, among other things &ndash; basic data wrangling concepts, concepts for cleaning messy datasets, and familiarity with programming concepts for creating a data flow that can be replicated and shared with multiple collaborators. This course will provide students with the skills necessary for successfully carrying out quantitative social science research, by deploying data science techniques.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The research questions students will engage with will be related to the political economy of development. For example, we will try to understand the relationship between the level of socio-economic development and political outcomes like incumbency and competition, examine the determinants of differences in quality of public service delivery and local institutions, or explore how the background of individual bureaucrats shapes their career trajectories. These broad sets of relationships will be examined from different perspectives throughout the course. We will begin by basic descriptive statistics, then visualize the data in different ways. To achieve this the course will rely on the R statistical software (open source) using a predefined set of freely available datasets (more details below). Students will learn how to gather, aggregate, analyze, and interpret datasets as well as presenting findings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The course can be divided into two broad parts that have substantial overlap. The first part of the course will focus on the basics of data science &ndash; data wrangling, visualization, and analysis. These skills will teach students how to aggregate, transform, and merge datasets for a richer analysis. The second part will focus on data gathering and cleaning. In this section, the students will be creating new datasets by gathering data from websites and APIs and then cleaning and processing the data. The aim here is to expose students to the challenges of creating new datasets.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>By the end of the course, students should be able to</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Understand basic programming terminologies, structures, and conventions</li>\n\t<li>Write, execute, and debug R code for data analysis, and visualization</li>\n\t<li>Be familiar with regular expressions and basic data cleaning techniques&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Be familiar with the basics of web scraping and APIs</li>\n\t<li>Be able to gather, analyze, visualize large scale datasets&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Be able to use understand and communicate relationship between variables&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Do preliminary geospatial analysis&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Overall goal of the course is to enabled students with the ability to gather new sets of data and pursue new research ideas&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Requirements</p>\n\n<p>Students are not required to have prior programming experience or a background in computer science to take this course.

This course provides an opportunity to critically assess the stories that shaped our own understanding of morals, culture, and values, as well as those we will impart to future generations. In this discussion-oriented interactive course, we will read and review children&rsquo;s books, examine the purposes of visual literacy, and write reviews on specific authors and illustrators.</p>\n\n<p>This course aims to examine how the books children read &ndash; from Aesop&rsquo;s Fables to Amar Chitra Katha comics and the Harry Potter series &ndash; shape their outlook and emotional development. We will study the historical, creative, nurturing, emotional, and educational aspects of these forms of literature and their impact on us later in life. We will also consider why a study of children&rsquo;s literature is important, and how it impacts pedagogies for children across borders.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also examine the views of multiple theoretical thinkers and texts in conjunction with actual children&#39;s literature. We will ask the important but often overlooked questions about this particular genre, mainly focusing on Indian and American children&rsquo;s literature. The purpose is not so much to compare these two cultural offerings, but to give us a taste of both.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall also consider popular books for children up to 12 years old, including Harry Potter &amp; The Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone, Amar Chitra Katha, Matilda, The Little Prince, and Alladin. At the same time, we will also study theoretical thinkers such as Jack Zipes, Seth Lerer, Paulo Freire, and Bruno Bettelheim to help us navigate the complex field of children&rsquo;s literature in relation to issues of culture, religion, difference, gender, and sexuality.</p>\n\n<p>We will also explore the didactic intent as well as the pleasure principle that might have prompted the writers. Authorial intent is, however, only one part of our study; the other part is to see how children and parents receive these stories. Children&rsquo;s literature creates moral as well as national frameworks that help acculturate young people. In examining the genre of children&rsquo;s literature, we will consider various sub-genres such as picture books, fairy tales, fables, and chapter books.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Rushdie, Salman.

Are our social interactions forms of playacting? How about the ways in which we present ourselves&mdash;as gendered bodies, as students, as friends, as professors, and as so many other less nameable identities&mdash;are these too performances? What would it tell us if we were to think of everyday social interaction and self-presentation as performance? Does this mean our interactions are shallow, our relationships fake, and our personalities mere pretense? Or will it reveal aspects of everyday life that otherwise remain hidden in plain view? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>These are some questions that inspire this course to explore the social phenomenon of performance and its theoretical value to the humanities. We will investigate the ways in which our everyday behaviours and the stories we tell shape our identities and our experience of the world. We will see how thinking <em>of</em>, <em>with</em>, and <em>through </em>performance can help us investigate social behaviour, individual and collective identity, and embodied knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We will do so by focusing on three recurring themes: first, the relationship between representation and performance, which will help us understand social behaviour; second, the paradigm of performativity, which is significant to theorizing identity; and third, the debate between whether performance is an ephemeral or enduring phenomenon, which is central to conceptualizing embodied knowledges. We will see, in short, how performance&mdash;as object, method, and analytic&mdash;can help us understand societies and cultures by focusing on acts of doing, ways of being, and modes of knowing. We will read Judith Butler, JL Austin, Diana Taylor, Richard Schechner, Susan Sontag, Harry Elam, Victor Turner, Bishnupriya Dutt, Erving Goffman, Clifford Geertz, Aparna Dharwadker, Ngugi wa Thiong&rsquo;o, and Paulla Ebron. We will also engage with Dharamvir Bharati&rsquo;s <em>Andha Yug</em>, Maya Rao&rsquo;s <em>Walk</em>, and the real-life cases of Rachel Dolezal and Jessica Krug.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>(Undergrads may sign up for&nbsp;ENG-2610 or PA-2610, while grads are welcome to sign up for ENG-4610.)&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

At the same time, graduate students often feel that writing within an academic institution does not bear much relevance to their lives outside of academia. To dispel such myths and make more happy ones for ourselves, in this course we will ask;&nbsp;How should we begin to think about writing? How is it possible to learn to write? Is writing purely a technical craft? What is criticism and how do we write critically about literature?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;While we discuss and dissent on the answers to these questions, we will also learn about all the delicate ways in which a hypothesis can be formulated, how to fashionably synthesize materials from written sources, organize ideas in almost perfect forms and develop marvelously captivating arguments.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

Was there always an &ldquo;India&rdquo;? This course begins with these questions and takes students through milestone moments of literature-making. Traversing different genres and languages from ancient times to the present day, the scope of this course is vast, for it has the provision of including a Buddhist nun&rsquo;s verses from the sixth century BCE to&nbsp;Khalid Jawed&rsquo;s&nbsp;The Paradise of Food&nbsp;(translated from Urdu by Baran Farooqi; awarded the JCB Prize in 2022). Clearly, it is not possible to expose the students to this entire range. However, the course aims to kindle profound interest in the intersections of languages and themes, the forms and genres that characterise the loosely named body called &ldquo;Indian literature/s.&rdquo; We will go from the ancient to medieval, colonial to modern and postcolonial body of writing&mdash;sometimes in detail, sometimes not. It would be difficult to say what gives unity, if any, to this body and whether this &ldquo;body&rdquo; is discursively formed through its users who read literature from Indian languages in English. The course examines the politics around such archives and the interrelationship between English and the&nbsp;bhashas. While the politics of language and translation underpin the instructor&rsquo;s theoretical approach, the course is committed to understanding&nbsp;the questions of&nbsp;history, region, community, caste, and region-making politics in India.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Ajay Navaria,&nbsp;Unclaimed Terrain&nbsp;(Translated from Hindi by Laura Brueck)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Anungla Zoe Longkumer (ed.),&nbsp;The Many That I am: Writings from Nagaland</p>\n\n<p>Dharamvir Bharati,&nbsp;Andha Yug&nbsp;(Translated from Hindi by Alok Bhalla)</p>\n\n<p>Salman Rushdie,&nbsp;Midnight&#39;s Children&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Susie Tharu and K.

Routine Eurocentric readings of Shakespeare assume that Christianity is the only religious influence on Shakespeare&rsquo;s work. And that Europe derived its poetic traditions autochthonously. But both these assumptions point to a paucity of the imagination rather than being an actual statement of fact. A play like Romeo and Juliet, for instance, owes a lot to Persian tales like Laila-Majnun and Shirin-Farhad. And a play like Richard II shares an investment in the poetic exploration of desire with the entire corpus of Sufi poetry. In the belief that it is time to present these Persianate links as avenues for exploration, this class will foreground the theoretical question of queer desire. The aesthetics of power, the impossibility of fulfilled desire, an enchantment with rhetorical dexterity, a depth of tumultuous affect, are some of the ideas with which we will engage in our twin exploration of Sufi and Shakespearean poetry and desire.</p>\n</div></div>"

And if it is local, can we think of modernities as alternative, multiple, and heterogeneous, but always connected and entangled phenomena?

The course will compare the histories of modernities at the turn of the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries by focussing on three themes: first, experiences of time and space; second, conceptions of the nation and the social; and third, discourses of rights and practices of discipline.

This is hardly surprising, because the world as it (supposedly) is would seem to give lie to any number of fantasies, abstractions, and ideologies. But there is danger here, for while reality may bite, appeals to both &ldquo;nature&rdquo; and &ldquo;realism&rdquo; are often wielded as cudgels against the speculative, the utopian, the ideal, and the non-normative. But realism and nature have a much closer relation, for we see in the same history a pattern of nature somehow raising the stakes on realism itself. This course will thus investigate the representation of nature and theories of realism more broadly. From key thinkers of realism such as Georg Luk&aacute;cs, Erich Auerbach, and Roland Barthes we will consider the representation of the non-human as theorized in works by Herman Melville, Adalbert Stifter, Aldo Leopold, Edward Abbey, Annie Dillard, Amitav Ghosh, and more recent ecocritical debates on realism. Of course, &ldquo;realism&rdquo; is hardly the sole repository of the literary environmental imagination, so we will contrast these texts with works by authors such as Ursula LeGuin and Kim Stanley Robinson. In doing so we may find that even such speculative genres as&nbsp;science fiction are &ldquo;realist&rdquo; in their own right!</p>\n</div></div>"

Even as it engages with new and urgent issues, adopts methods opened up by new technologies, and identifies fresh objects of study that promise greater relevance and staying power, postcolonial studies is also encountering challenges to its historical focus and its method as critique.

Consequently, it regards the politics of indigenous peoples as a legitimate concern of the discipline. The histories of decolonization and the Cold War that have shaped the contemporary world order signal another major historical investment of the &lsquo;new&rsquo; postcolonial studies. In addition, alternative geographies produced by globalization and new configurations of regionalisms (such as Indian Ocean studies, or the Black Atlantic) offer a turn away from the exclusive earlier focus on the colonized regions of Africa, the Caribbean and Asia.</p>\n\n<p>February 13: Different Histories and Alternative Geographies-1</p>\n\n<p>Decolonial Studies:</p>\n\n<p>--Walter Mignolo, &ldquo;The Conceptual Triad: Modernity/Coloniality/Decoloniality.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>--Maldonaldo-Torres, &ldquo;Colonialism, Neocolonial, Internal Colonialism, the Postcolonial, Coloniality, and Decoloniality.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>--Coloniality at Large, excerpts.</p>\n\n<p>--Gurminder Bhambra, &ldquo;Postcolonial and decolonial dialogues.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>--Discussion of On Decoloniality in Postcolonial Studies,&nbsp;23:4,&nbsp;2020.

The politics and processes of such rivalry and substitution repay scrutiny. In what ways are the definitions, agendas, historical contexts and canons of postcolonial literature and world literature overlapping and related, and in what ways are they distinct or even antagonistic? We will pay particular attention to recent arguments originating in the critique of knowledge-production in the west that question the framing of world literature within a primarily European comparatist framework, and seek to restore its overlooked colonial genealogy as reflected in the histories of philology and, more broadly, orientalism.</p>\n\n<p>April 5: World Literature 1</p>\n\n<p>Background:</p>\n\n<p>--[Goethe, Marx, Auerbach, Tagore</p>\n\n<p>--Casanova, &ldquo;Literature as a World&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>--Damrosch, &ldquo;What is&nbsp; World Literature?&rdquo; (excerpts)</p>\n\n<p>--Moretti, &ldquo;Conjectures on World Literature&rdquo;]</p>\n\n<p>Postcolonial Interventions</p>\n\n<p>--Francesca Orsini, &quot;India in the Mirror of world Fiction,&quot; NLR</p>\n\n<p>--Warwick Collective</p>\n\n<p>--Brouillette, UNESCO and the Fate of the Literary, Introduction.</p>\n\n<p>--Popescu, &quot;Historical Vantage Points: The Rise of the World Literature Paradigm.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>-- Supriya Chaudhuri, &ldquo;Which World?

Your responses should be not less than 100 words long (about 10 lines). They can take the form of an interpretation, an opinion, a question, a comparison, an exposition, a close reading, an endorsement, a disagreement. . .

The pursuit of this encounter is common across religious traditions and, during the period known as the Middle Ages, became an increasingly popular form of religious expression around the world. In this course, we ask, how can we make sense of spiritual experiences that exceed a post-enlightenment sense of the real? How can we read textual and visual representations of the inexpressible? Without homogenizing or simplifying how might we read mysticism comparatively across religious traditions?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>With these questions in mind, this course offers a comparative introduction to medieval mysticism from Christian, Jewish, Islamic, and Hindu traditions. Examining writings by and of a wide variety of mystics&mdash;from Hildegard von Bingen to Kabir to Rabia of Basra&mdash;we will historically situate medieval visionaries while also considering points of intersection. From a literary studies perspective, we will explore the tensions between individual experience and communal or institutional religion; the kinds of authority and challenges to authority that these experiences created; the relationship between experiences of the spirit and practices of the body; the ways in which mysticism reflects and challenges pre-modern notions of gender and sexuality; and the problem of expressing the inexpressible. In the process, we will investigate the interpretative questions that mystical visions raise for historians and scholars of religion and examine the theories that scholars have used to study these types of religious experiences.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Please note: this course has two mandatory Saturday or Sunday (depending on student availability) visits that count as part of our course hours.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

What supported the diagnosis was most immediately prolificity&mdash;what had earlier been a thin trickle of such works became a steady flow. The new fiction came to be seen moreover as a marked break from the kind of writing that went before, in terms of both its themes as well as the literary experimentation it attempted. Above all, there was the fact of the publication and recognition of the new writers in the west, which meant large international readerships.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is widely acknowledged that the single factor responsible for these changes is the publication of Salman Rushdie&rsquo;s Midnight&rsquo;s Children in 1981. Midnight&rsquo;s Children is informed by the ambition of narrating the nation, signalled by Rushdie&rsquo;s device of twinning the destiny of its protagonist Saleem Sinai with that of the new Indian nation, both born at midnight on August 15,</p>\n\n<p>1947. The Anglophone novel in India in following him is therefore regarded as a project in writing the nation. It is the nation&mdash;or more accurately, India-- as optic, invention and</p>\n\n<p>investment that was perceived as driving the &lsquo;new&rsquo; Indian novel in English.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, Rushdie&rsquo;s influence has been challenged, and the thematic of the nation has been side-stepped, by several writers. We will therefore be open to the counter-thesis that other influences than Rushdie (notably, V.S. Naipaul), and other preoccupations than the nation inform (some of) the writing of this period.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Students will be required to read one novel every week, alongside one or two related critical essays. So prior familiarity with some of the novels of the period (and at least one of Naipaul&rsquo;s novels) would be an asset.</p>\n\n<p>Academic Integrity:&nbsp; There is zero tolerance in this course for any form of academic dishonesty, including multiple submissions, cheating, and plagiarism. Any of these offenses will be reported to the OAA and will result in failure of the plagiarized assignment. If you have any questions about what constitutes plagiarism in the context of this course, please reach out to me.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Accommodations and Accessibility:&nbsp;If you require accommodations, please contact the Office of Learning Support&nbsp;at&nbsp;ols@ashoka.edu.in.

The question of what is noble, which is perhaps Nietzsche&rsquo;s most interesting question, is what is repressed in this project (and as such returns to vitiate its egalitarian claims in various ways). In this course we will see how one of South Asia&rsquo;s first readers of Nietzsche, the Urdu and Persian poet Muhammad Iqbal, gave a centrality to this problem in both his poetry and his philosophical prose. In this course we will read both Nietzsche&rsquo;s works as well as Iqbal&rsquo;s poems (in translation) and prose along with some other thinkers of that period like Henri Bergson and A.N. Whitehead. The objective of this course is to come to an understanding of what Iqbal meant by reconstruction and what that entails for our understanding of a political and philosophical position that takes the question of nobility seriously.</p>\n</div></div>"

These folktales shape our perception of the world, and in turn, are reshaped each time they are retold. How do we study these everyday narratives critically? Why do some tales stay with us while others fade from memory? What purpose do they serve in the world? How do social issues inform folk narratives? And how do folk narratives change the world in turn, for better or worse? Our aim is not to arrive at overarching theories but to regard folktales in their local and historical contexts as stories that are sometimes subversive and at others, reactionary.</p>\n\n<p>The course will begin by situating fairy tales at the intersection between folklore and literature, and go on to explore other sub-genres of the folktale including urban legends, rumours, jokes and conspiracy theories. We will read selections from wide-ranging contexts from texts like the Grimm brothers&rsquo; fairy tales, <em>The Panchatantra</em>, <em>The Arabian Nights</em>, <em>Thakurmar Jhuli</em> etc. Along with oral and written narratives, we will look into their audio-visual variants in the culture industry as well. Our readings will be informed by theoretical works by Jack Zipes, Sadhana Naithani, Maria Tatar, Sigmund Freud and others. The aim is to approach the genre of the folktale from different theoretical vantage points including the ethnographic and the performative, but also feminist and postcolonial ones. We will simultaneously work on the fundamental aspects of academic writing such as structuring a coherent piece, developing a persuasive argument, dialoguing with existing research etc.</p>\n</div></div>"

The primary objective of the course then is to develop a critical language towards understanding and addressing care and love as the basis for a relationship with oneself and between oneself and others.</p>\n</div></div>"

We will begin by acquainting ourselves with comics vocabulary and grammar (panel transitions, gutter space, word-image relations) and then learn to apply them to understand why and how we consume/are consumed by this medium.

I also plan to bring&nbsp;in some material from outside India &ndash; the stories of Junichiro Tanizaki, for instance.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question in the course title is one I asked myself as I began putting together the anthology I mention&nbsp;above in the late 1990s. How was one to conceive of a tradition called &#39;Indian literature&#39;? Was&nbsp;it the total of thevarious literatures of India? Or was there another way of exploring this category? It was a time when the Indian novel in English and the idea of &#39;postcolonial literature&#39;&nbsp;had begun to dominate. How did the modernist and avant garde trajectories of literatures in the Indian languages fit into these relatively recent categorisations? One of my own reasons for rethinking and enlarging the frame had to do with my affinities with modernism as a reader and writer, affinities that seemed out of place post-Midnight&#39;s Children, but not so out of place within the experimental histories of<br />\nmodern Indian literatures themselves. The use of the word &#39;modern&#39;&nbsp;was, and is, deliberate, to point to developments that the term &#39;postcolonial&#39;&nbsp;doesn&#39;t address. The texts we&#39;ll read here would&nbsp;follow, without too much narrow systematising, &lsquo;Indian literature&rsquo; and the way its emergence from the late nineteenth century in various languages embodied the trajectory of modernity, modernism, the avant garde, and formal preoccupations in India. The course means to question the largely theme-driven, Anglophone parameters of the &lsquo;postcolonial&rsquo; that have been with us for some decades now.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;As in 2022, this will be a hybrid course, co-hosted by The Oxford Research&nbsp;Centre of the Humanities. Participants will join in from all over&nbsp;the world, but the core class will comprise Ashoka University students, who will take the course in person and will be required to write two essays of 1500 words each over the course of the semester.&#39;&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Students from Oxford and other universities will be sitting in on the class, and will participate in discussions.

We will consider what questions these problems raise for historians&#39; use of textual sources by looking at writing as a social, material, and political act. What were the symbolic meanings attributed to writings that most people could not understand? What practical uses could writing serve? How did access to writing intersect with other social hierarchies, like gender and class? Beginning with the invention of writing in the Yellow River region, we will discuss problems such as: the relationship between speech and writing; changes in writing materials; writing for display and writing for use; censorship; Chinese characters in non-Chinese societies; and debates over script reform.</p>\n\n<p>The written assessment for this class will build towards a final research paper on a topic of the students&#39; choice.</p>\n</div></div>"

It will focus on some of the dominant traditions of historical writing, and the internal dialogues within the traditions. It will move from positivism to critical theory, from Marxism to the Annales, from the French historical tradition to English social history, from Foucault&rsquo;s discursive turn to Michel de Certeau&rsquo;s focus on everyday practice. Through this journey, we will reflect on some of the binaries that often shape historical thinking &ndash;&ndash; the questions of history and myth, certainty and ambiguity, objectivity and prejudice, truth and falsehood &ndash;&ndash; and see how these notions are questioned and rethought over time.</p>\n\n<p>If historians in the nineteenth century established some of the founding premises of the historian&rsquo;s craft, the &lsquo;critical turn&rsquo; from the 1970s has powerfully questioned many of these assumptions, underlining the complex nature of historical practice. It has persuaded historians to ask: what does it mean to enter the archive and mine the traces of the past, to read the record, to see and represent, to narrate, and to write a story based on evidence? This course will explore what this critical turn has meant to the writing of history, how it has forced historians to question earlier frames, and opened up new worlds of research.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>THEMES AND LECTURES:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Introduction: On Reading History</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>I: MODERNITY AND HISTORICAL KNOWEDGE</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>1) Ranke, Acton and the Shaping of the Historical Discipline</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; Readings:</strong></p>\n\n<p>G.

The state carries much of<br />\nthe responsibility for social change in liberal conceptions of social order.

Nearly every aspect about&nbsp;them is disputed &ndash; from their role in &ldquo;feeding the world&rdquo; and their impacts with respect to yield and environment to regulatory policies and peoples&rsquo; notions of choice and ethics. This course examines the GM debate by looking at the transformations of agriculture and agricultural sciences in the 20th century. It analyzes how private industry has sought profits from agriculture, and the consequent impacts on farming communities. This will help us grasp deeper issues that are often lost in heated anti/pro-GM arguments. Surveying controversies in India, the USA and other parts of the world, the course will demonstrate how the GM debate is shaped by the inter-related shifts in law, politics, and science. By way of examining the case of Bt cotton, Golden Rice, Bt brinjal&nbsp;among others, the course ultimately invites the question: Where do GM crops fit in the landscape of the burning issues faced by the average farmer, if at all?</p>\n\n<p>More broadly, the questions we will consider in this class are, in fact, relevant to most technologies incident upon agriculture, and on the relationship between technology and society, in general. Our learnings from this course will carry over to a larger set of issues than GM crops alone.</p>\n\n<p>This is a&nbsp;seminar course&nbsp;i.e. it is a discussion-oriented course that relies on close reading of research.

The concept of social exclusion as an analytical framework has become increasingly relevant for an understanding of the notions of environmental inequality, conflicts, rights and justice. The course will capture the social exclusion structures and processes which restrict the access of certain social groups to environmental resources and entitlements. It will explain the different forms of social disadvantage &ndash; in village and community, in land and water, in space and commons, in wilderness and conservation &ndash; that persist, in multiple variants and with different intensity, across societies and nations. It will locate the agency to groups that either guard their domain of privilege or challenge the system of social inequalities and segmentation. Thus, understanding social exclusion as a condition/outcome as well as a dynamic process, the course will also examine some environmental justice movements. The course will also be contextually and temporally embedded. In the north, for example, along with African-Americans, Latino and indigenous people, the focus has been the changing nature of social exclusion in environment. Accordingly, the relevant focus groups are the new social groups, including the immigrants and ethnic groups. By contrast, in the Indian context, the problem is one of the persistent, multiple exclusion of certain social groups like Dalit affecting their basic environmental access and rights.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The course is organized around weekly lectures and discussions based on the readings.

A modern biologist can use multiple tools to make sense of data and uncover signals that help describe how the world works. This course is aimed at providing a toolkit to help research students design field and laboratory studies and link data to models (a description of how the world works). The discussion topics include replication and pseudoreplication, randomisation, sample size and degrees of freedom, orthogonal design, and non-orthogonal observational data. The topics on statistical modelling include parameter estimation, model prediction, overfitting, collinearity, missing data, approaches to choosing models, and model simplification. This course will be taught through lectures and worksheets using the R programming language. The example datasets used in the worksheets will be from ecological, biomedical, and social sciences.</p>\n\n<p>Statistical modelling is as much art as it is a craft. Students will be encouraged to think about creative ways to model seemingly disparate datasets.

Over the past few decades, critical scholarship on disaster and vulnerability has grown significantly, drawing on, among others, frameworks of political economy and political ecology. At the same time, hazards and disasters have also become increasingly frequent and destructive across the planet. From mega events such as tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, nuclear accidents and oil spills to slow-onset disasters like air pollution, desertification, epidemics, soil erosion and sea level rise, disaster has come to define the times that we live in. Climate change has made matters worse. The impact of a disaster is uneven, however; some people are much more vulnerable than others.</p>\n\n<p>This course is aimed at providing students critical perspectives on disaster and vulnerability. We will begin with an overview of concepts such as risk, hazards, disaster, vulnerability, and resilience. Drawing on case studies from around the world, the course will then expose students to a variety of political and cultural questions concerning disaster and vulnerability. The students will learn about, among others, the role of the state and capital in the production of disaster and hazardscape; how vulnerability is a social calculus; ideas of climate coloniality and climate justice; how various societies in different historical moments have responded to calamity, offering insight into the complex relationships between societies and their natural environments; and how disaster management efforts can promote widespread resilience or increase the vulnerability of some populations, thereby further deepening societal inequities. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

In contemporary imaginations, mountains are essential for the planet&rsquo;s survival and indeed our own physical and mental health. But this was not always the case. In pre-modern Europe, for example, mountains were either ignored or depicted in literature as ugly deformities that scarred the Earth&rsquo;s surface. Why did Europeans think of mountains as ugly? How, when, and why did their aesthetic imaginations change to a point where someone like the celebrated polymath John Ruskin could write that &ldquo;mountains are the beginning and the end of all scenery&rdquo;? How did European perceptions of mountains differ from that of the peoples and traditions of South Asia and elsewhere? And what role has South Asian history played in shaping modern human relationships with the mountains?</p>\n\n<p>This course will take students on a journey from early Asia and pre- modern Europe, to the eighteenth-century when the Alps emerged as objects of adventure, veneration, and scientific experimentation, which in turn, kickstarted two new modern practices&mdash; mountain tourism and the world&rsquo;s most literary sport, mountaineering. This course will then explore how these practices were deeply imbricated with colonialism, nationalism, fascism, and masculinity in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. The course will end in the late twentieth century where it will focus on commercialization of mountaineering and on issues pertaining to non-European modernity. In other words, this course will take students on a journey from a stage in human history where mountains were at best the abode of gods and spirits, and, at worst, ugly deformities, to a stage where there are now &ldquo;traffic jams&rdquo; on Mount Everest.</p>\n\n<p>Focused on the Alps and the Himalaya, this interdisciplinary course will offer a new and exciting vantage point for learning about several fundamental issues and concepts in history and the humanities. Students will learn how scholars in the humanities have rehabilitated mountains as a key terrain where modernity is performed, its limits are exposed, and occasionally transcended. They will also learn about the extent to which our knowledge of the world is framed from the perspective of those who live in the &ldquo;lowlands.&rdquo; Overall, this course will motivate students to think of the history of human interactions with mountains as vital for making sense of what it means to be modern, and, for understanding how we got there.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Tenative Course Syllabus</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><u><strong>Module I: A Cultural History of Mountains</strong></u></p>\n\n<p><u>Week 1: Mountains in Pre-Modern European Imagination and World History</u></p>\n\n<p>Marjorie Hope Nicholson <em>Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory: The Development of the Aesthetics of the Infinite,</em> pp. 34-71.</p>\n\n<p>James Scott <em>The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland South Asia</em> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009), pp. 127-177.</p>\n\n<p><u>Week 2: Mountains in Pre-modern India</u></p>\n\n<p>Kalidasa, <em>Meghaduta</em> excerpts</p>\n\n<p>Kalidasa, <em>Kumarasambhava</em>, excerpts</p>\n\n<p>Nachiket Chanchani <em>Mountain Temples and Temple Mountains: Architecture, Religion and Nature in Central Himalaya</em>, pp. 25-74.</p>\n\n<p><u>Week 3: Scared Mountain in Early to Middle China</u></p>\n\n<p>Wei- Cheng Lin, <em>Building A Sacred Mountain: The Buddhist Architecture of China&rsquo;s Mount Wutai</em>, pp. 51-88.</p>\n\n<p>Wen-shing Chou <em>Mount Wutai Vision of a Sacred Buddhist Mountain</em>, excerpts</p>\n\n<p><u>Week 4: Environment and Aesthetics in Modern Europe</u></p>\n\n<p>Marjorie Hope Nicholson <em>Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory: The Development of The Aesthetics of the Infinite</em> pp. 324-369.</p>\n\n<p>Allen Carlson <em>Nature and Landscape: An Introduction to Environmental Aesthetics,</em> chapter 1, pp. 1-37.</p>\n\n<p>Jon Mathieu, &ldquo;The Sacralization of Mountains in Europe during the Modern Age&rdquo; <em>Mountain Research and Development</em>, 26 (4), pp. 343-349</p>\n\n<p><u>Week 5: Three interpretations of Change in European Attitudes towards the Mountains</u></p>\n\n<p>Marjorie Hope Nicholson <em>Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory: The Development of The Aesthetics of the Infinite </em>pp. 271-323.</p>\n\n<p>Peter Hansen <em>The Summits of the Modern Man: Mountaineering After Enlightenment</em> pp. 30-60.</p>\n\n<p>B.

The course is theoretically rigorous and empirically grounded.&nbsp;It covers a wide range of issues, including the classical agrarian question, contemporary agrarian debates, green revolution and its legacies, the question(s) of food, land and water grabbing, farmer suicides in India, gender and agriculture, transnational peasant movements, and the recent farmers protest in India. This course will be run as a seminar, which means students will be expected to actively participate in class discussions. As part of the course, students will also get a chance to watch some iconic films on the agrarian worlds. Furthermore, there will be a few field visits for students to gain a firsthand exposure to certain aspects of the agradian world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

Between slums and smart cities, they inhabit a world of social conflict, ecological crisis, and contending visions of the future. As cities become even more central to social experience and aspiration, we need to understand their place in history and in the human imagination. This course looks at cities through three thematic lenses: accumulation, order, and identity. It studies cities in relation to the countryside, tracing flows of people and goods that create wealth and poverty. It examines the spatial politics of managing urban populations, from planning to informality. It analyses cities as places where cultural identities &ndash; parochial and progressive &ndash; are formed and defended. It introduces urban studies as a critical area of sociology and anthropology, and as an essential prerequisite for understanding environmental politics.</p>\n</div></div>"

In this module, students will apply the basics of community ecology to understanding invasives and their socio-economic impacts.</p>\n\n<p>Simberloff, D. et al. 2013.

The key rationale employed here is that the reinstatement of the top-down forces of predation prevents &lsquo;ecosystem collapse&rsquo;. In this module we examine one of the most celebrated cases of reintroduction- that of gray wolves to the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem in North America- in relation to debates on bottom-up and top-down trophic forces. The cheetah reintroduction in India will also be examined from the sustainability perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Readings:</p>\n\n<p>Ripple, W.J., T.P. Rooney and R.L. Beschta. 2010.

The plant and animal communities are likely to be very different from those that &nbsp;existed a few decades ago and bear the imprint of both ongoing ecological processes and human activities. We will explore the successional patterns in plant communities and how these patterns manifest in variations in communities of animals and plants that depend on them.</p>\n\n<p>Background Reading:</p>\n\n<p>Krebs, C.J. 2009.

The city is a place where social churning is visible, yet history constrains positive change in many ways. This module aims to introduce the students to the social-ecological complexity of the city through a comparative approach. Students will attempt to discover temporal trends across two metropolitan cities- Delhi and Bengaluru-and analyze the role of science in urban management.</p>\n\n<p>Readings:</p>\n\n<p>Agarwal, R. 2018. &lsquo;Natural&rsquo; no More?

The three broad sets of decisions that finance managers undertake are&mdash;decisions on where to invest the resources or funds that the business has raised, either internally or externally (the investment decision), decisions on where and how to raise funds to finance these investments (the financing decision), and decisions on how much and in what form to return funds back to the owners (the dividend decision). The course will include the central concepts of modern finance: basic accounting principles and financial statements analysis, net present value, valuation models, efficient markets, and the trade-off between risk and return, fundamentals of capital structure and an introduction to corporate dividend policies and their implications for valuation. The course uses a mix of theory and practice for exposition.</p>\n\n<p><strong>List of topics covered:</strong></p>\n\n<p>1) Basic accounting, Balance sheet and income statement analysis, cash flow analysis and financial models</p>\n\n<p>2) Capital Budgeting: Discounted cash flow analysis, Time value of Money, NPV, IRR and other investment rules, Capital investment decision making</p>\n\n<p>3) Analysis of Risk - sensitivity and scenario analysis, break even analysis, Real options and capital budgeting</p>\n\n<p>4) Bonds and bond valuation, government bonds, corporate bonds, pricing of bonds, risks associated with investing in bonds, bond yields and their determinants and the yield curve.</p>\n\n<p>5) Stock valuation &ndash; methods of valuation, ratios for comparisons, introduction to stock markets, exchanges and trading</p>\n\n<p>6) Risk and return &ndash; Market history, CAPM</p>\n\n<p>7) Weighted Average Cost of capital</p>\n\n<p>8) Market efficiency</p>\n\n<p>9) Capital structure &ndash; Basics, use of debt and valuation and capital budgeting for a levered firm</p>\n\n<p>10) Dividend Policy</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Corporate Finance by Stephen A.

The course overviews some of the unique cultural and intellectual developments, which have taken place in the Indian sub-continent, beginning with the mysterious Indus Valley civilization, and ending with political imagination in Bollywood films. We will explore the religious thought and practice of Hindu, Buddhist and Jain religions, Indian philosophical traditions &ndash; both classical and modern -, classical aesthetic theory and literature, and interrelations between Islam and indigenous religions. We will attempt to look at Indian civilizations from several points of view &ndash; traditional and historical, sympathetic and critical. We will try to trace historical continuities and ruptures, examples of cultural synthesis and antagonism, as well as critically examine how cultural insiders and outsiders have imagined and represented Indian civilizations.</p>\n</div></div>"

At other times just thinking logically or geometrically is enough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You will work with your group to solve puzzles, and then write up the solutions on your&nbsp;own. No prior knowledge of mathematics is required to be able to solve the puzzles. But you will be required to use some computer algebra and some basic programming (which you have to pick up with the help of your group) to experiment and find patterns. The objective&nbsp;is to develop a taste for problem-solving and learn (with the help of some friends) the pleasures of getting creative ideas.</p>\n\n<p>There is a further book reading component to the course&hellip;a book review. There will be a different book assigned to each group. The objective is to gain an appreciation for mathematics and how it is used in the world around us. In addition, the group has to present their book. Past presentations have involved making movies, writing and enacting plays, writing poetry, and various unique ways of storytelling.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the course, I expect students to gain an appreciation for mathematics, learn something about its culture, and experience the joy that&nbsp;accompanies&nbsp;a creative&nbsp;idea.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>No prior knowledge of mathematics (other than what is covered in middle school) is required. No prior knowledge of programming is required.&nbsp;It is expected that students who are comfortable with mathematics will help others who are not so comfortable with math.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>At the end of the course, students will learn many&nbsp;mathematical topics (such as those covered in high school), but more importantly you&nbsp;will know how to learn in case you&nbsp;encounter mathematics in your&nbsp;studies or work. We will give tools to visualize mathematical ideas and make sense of them. Students should also get an appreciation for mathematics and what mathematicians do.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Resources:</strong>&nbsp; In the first week, groups will be made. A book will be assigned to a group. Read on own&nbsp;own, discuss with each other&nbsp;and write a book review;&nbsp;and present to the rest of the class.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Google Classroom. Resources may be uploaded here from time to time.</li>\n\t<li>Graphing Calculator: Desmos:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.desmos.com\">https://www.desmos.com</a></li>\n\t<li>Sage. A symbolic algebra package available at <a href=\"https://www.sagemath.org\">https://www.sagemath.org</a>.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>There are 3 aspects to the grading.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>1. Daily/Weekly quizzes/puzzles (almost every day).</p>\n\n<p>Weightage: 50%. 10 best will be used for determining grades. Every week&#39;s quizzes will be added up to obtain a weekly score. 10 Best weekly scores will be taken. Some of these will consist of the puzzles being solved by you working in groups. But you need to write the solution on your own. Others will be quizzes on the basis of what is taught in the lecture itself. (Groups in class will&nbsp;be different from the Group for the presentation.)</p>\n\n<p>2. Portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>Weightage: 10%. The collection of things you learnt in the course.</p>\n\n<p>3. Group project: Book presentation and Book Review. Weightage: 40%.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Every group will have to make a&nbsp;presentation&nbsp;during the semester about the topic of their book and write a book review. The groups will be made by the faculty team and a book assigned to you in the beginning of the semester. The presentations will begin from Week 3 or 4 and will go on for the rest of the semester.</p>\n\n<p>The presentations of last year&#39;s QRMT are available here.&nbsp;https://sites.google.com/ashoka.edu.in/qrmtspring2022/home. You may speak with the people there to get an idea of what is involved for the presentation. A sample portfolio is also available there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>There is no attendance policy. If you don&#39;t come, you miss the quiz of the day. There will be no make-up quizzes. Since we will drop a couple of quizzes, that should account for emergencies. So it is advised that you take this course only if you are sure you have the time in your busy schedule to attend the classes. There is no homework and no exams.&nbsp;But it is expected you will spend time with your group outside of class and every presentation is a group effort.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

The idea of conserving nature has undergone a shift from &ldquo;wilderness preservation&rdquo; to a more formal discipline concerned with &ldquo;biodiversity conservation&rdquo;. This transition was not sudden and many steps in this transition had underpinnings of theoretical and empirical findings. In this course, we will discuss how we know what biological diversity is and how can we measure it. Where is biodiversity located and how do we prioritise areas for conservation? Along the course, the students will be introduced to the tools for measuring and monitoring biodiversity. We will discuss how biodiversity monitoring is playing a major part in providing a nuanced understanding of human impacts on biodiversity at multiple levels &ndash; diversity of species, genetic diversity, and diversity of ecosystems. Throughout the course, we will underscore that conservation problems are multi-faceted. George Schaller describes the social and political nature of conservation &ndash; &ldquo;Instead of being just a biologist, something for which I was trained, I must also be an educator, diplomat, fundraiser, politician,<br />\nanthropologist...&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><br />\nCourse cap - 100</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Anne E.

Science also provides an unparalleled view of the order and symmetry of the universe and its workings&mdash;subatomic particles to the never-ending space. Science enables you to integrate with your surroundings, both living and non-living. It has also given us the tools to alter living and non-living things. It has the potential to have both positive impacts such as coping with natural disasters, curing diseases, and discovering new sources of energy, as well as negative impacts in the form of climate change and weapons of mass destruction.<br />\n<br />\nThe course narrates some of the key theoretical and technical developments in the evolution of the sciences and offers a synoptic view of the development of concepts that drive modern science.</p>\n\n<p>Faculty: Alok Bhattacharya (AB), Department of Biology</p>\n\n<p>alok.bhattacharya@ashoka.edu.in</p>\n\n<p>Shraddha karve (SK), Department of Biology</p>\n\n<p>shraddha.karve@ashoka.edu.in</p>\n\n<p>Lecture topics</p>\n\n<p>What is Science&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It will introduce the concepts of length scales and their effects from examples out of our experience and analyze the broad basis at a pedagogical level. Understanding from electronic to atomic and molecular scale&nbsp;to coarse graining in biological systems has enriched the multi-scale effects in science. The large length limit of classical mechanics has been one that forms a well understood part of science.&nbsp;The discovery of quantum mechanics about a hundred years back has been one of the most disruptive ones and is established as one which allows us to understand the small length science. The metaphysics behind quantum mechanics will be explained. The course will also deal with intermediate length scales, going up from smaller length scales progressively upwards to mesoscopic length, which has been of great recent interest that has enriched science, from quantum systems to Nanotechnology to system level biology. It will be taught at a level which will be of interest to those not only interested in science, but also humanities.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>General pedagogy of science is applied across systems with emphasis on relevance to chemistry.

It is a selective study of some of the contributions of the great thinkers in the history of economic analysis. We shall visit the historical contexts as well as contemporary relevance of these ideas.</p>\n\n<p>The course begins with the key question of what determines value of a commodity or service. We will discuss the theories of value and distribution, beginning with classical thinkers Smith, Ricardo, Marx and Mill, and culminating in contributions of Jevons, Menger and Marshall.&nbsp; The labour theory of value, where a commodity&rsquo;s value depends on the amount of labour used in its production, gave way to the utility theory of value, where value depends on the (marginal) satisfaction (utility) we derive from its consumption. The questions, such as whether the measure of value should be objective or subjective, whether &lsquo;intrinsic value&rsquo; matters, are still relevant today. Closely related to the notion of value is the question of how the proceeds of production get distributed amongst the various participants (factors). The course visits these theories of distribution and reflects on the present-day concerns about declining labour share and rising inequality, in the light of rapid and transformative technological developments.</p>\n\n<p>Adam Smith&rsquo;s description and appreciation of the natural order in the society led to the most celebrated metaphor- the &lsquo;invisible hand&rsquo;. The course examines how the notion of market mediated coordination of the pursuits of self-interest by individuals has dominated economic thinking over the last two centuries. The orderly nature of market outcomes, resulting from competition, was further analysed and formalised by Walras and Marshall in different ways, leading to the notion of a market equilibrium, which became part of modern economic analysis. Later developments have highlighted several frictions in the market mechanisms, some of which will be studied in the course. The notion of equilibrium was developed independently, in more abstract and general institutional settings, culminating in the works of Nash (A Beautiful Mind!).</p>\n\n<p>While aggregate output and wealth was always a dominant theme for the classical thinkers starting with Smith, systematic analysis of the economy at the aggregate level took off with Keynes and some of his contemporaries. Many have described the Keynesian revolution as a response to the Great Depression, and some of the policy prescriptions keep surfacing in modern times as well. The course ends with a short analysis of the financial crisis, highlighting the role of markets and values, as discussed earlier in the course.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Readings</p>\n\n<p>We will be using selected chapters from different sources, not necessarily textbooks, all available in the library.

Is state sovereignty weakening in the face of globalization, expanding human rights norms and transnational activism? The aim of this course is to explore the ways in which global social, economic and political processes and structures impact international politics. It focuses on understanding the nature of political<br />\npower and its manifestations through the evolution of the modern nation state. We will deal with a range of issues &ndash; from conventional geopolitics and security concerns, to nuclear and autonomous weapons, climate, food and energy security to pandemics in an attempt to explore the ways in which states respond to and are challenged by global challenges. The course serves to sensitize students to differences in the nature of knowledge claims (epistemology) and fundamental assumptions about social/international reality (ontology) as well as political and ethical implications of different theoretical approaches in understanding world politics.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Continuous assessment through the semester.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>There are three excused absences allowed for during the semester.</p>\n</div></div>"

After a short overview of major historiographical trends and political entities, the course moves from the usual centres of political and economic narratives into the perceptions of ordinary people. Once seen from their eyes, what did constitute the place called India in a millennium usually identified as &ldquo;medieval&rdquo;? How can we think of its history at a time when numerous languages, unformidable borders&nbsp;and insufficient technologies of communication and travel hardly connected the north with the south, east with the west?</p>\n\n<p>We shall explore this history of an India that did or did not exist in the eyes of people, languages, texts and objects. With a combination of lectures&nbsp;and a close reading of secondary and primary sources, we shall study &ldquo;medieval Indian history&rdquo; in our own ways by keeping to the foundational rules of history: evidence, description&nbsp;and analysis. We will focus on people such as peasants, artisans, traders, travellers, mystics, dancers, beggars, slaves, servants, soldiers, smugglers, thieves, pilgrims, prostitutes, eunuchs and transvestites, but a similar approach can also be taken for languages (such as Sanskrit, Tamil, Bengali, Kannada, Persian, Assamese, Telugu, Persian, Braj, and Hindi/Urdu) and regions (varying from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Kabul to Bengal, Bihar to Malabar, Indore to Lahore, Assam to Andhra, Delhi to Dhaka) through simultaneous frameworks of micro-history and macro-history. The lectures will focus on the people while discussions will focus on languages and regions.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The successful completion of this course helps you</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>To acquire a better knowledge of Indian or South Asian history between ca. 800 and 1800 CE.</li>\n\t<li>To read primary and secondary sources, to conduct basic historic research, and to present one&rsquo;s arguments on the basis of primary sources.</li>\n\t<li>To understand historical practices and methodologies in dealing with the premodern period.</li>\n\t<li>To think about the past critically and to comprehend scholarly arguments while keeping integrity in the responsible use of historical materials.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>All students must read Catherine Asher and Cynthia Talbot&rsquo;s India before Europe (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006) and Manan Ahmed Asif&rsquo;s The Loss of Hindustan: The Invention of India (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2020) in addition to the readings assigned for each class.

Seeking answers to these questions, this course brings in dialogue the works of art with the spaces that such works have come to inhabit in our present world &ndash; museums, art galleries, and other spaces of visual exhibitions. Moving beyond the established trajectories of looking at exhibitions, museums, and gallery spaces as&nbsp;storehouses of masterpieces of Art, or merely as spaces of ordering, classifying, and displaying objects and images, we will look closely at how exhibition practices of&nbsp;museums and public art galleries, constitute the very category &ldquo;Art&rdquo; around a select body of objects and images.</p>\n\n<p>Beginning with early modern royal and notable private collections, and cabinet of curiosities across the world, the course will explore the specific moments of the coming into being of public museums and art galleries through fairs, &ldquo;freak shows&rdquo;, and world exhibitions in Europe and across different parts of the world. It will explore how politics of collection, museum acquisition, display, and repatriation are tied with larger questions of colonialism, war, loot, postcolonial nationalist reassertions, and postwar encounters with race and ethnicity.&nbsp;With a specific focus on Asia, the course will map the connected global trajectories of museums, art galleries and memorials as dense narratives of unfolding spatial and temporal complexes. In the process it will highlight the role of the artists, curators, and museum/ gallery visitors in the production of a complex set of dialogues around artistic, and curatorial visions.</p>\n\n<p>The course will end by looking at contemporary South Asia, mapping the challenges of redesigning exhibition orders of older museums and art institutions and spread of museum modes of display and viewing, with different intent, in commemorative sites, theme parks, memorials, and new temples. This co-constitution of art and art museums will be addressed during class discussions and during visits to local galleries, museums, theme parks, and temples &ndash; to&nbsp;the Indian Museum, Kolkata, the National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi the National Museum, New Delhi, the National Handloom and Handicrafts Musem, New Delhi, the Rashtriya Dalit Prerna Sthal, Nodia, the Swaminarayan Akshardham Complex, New Delhi, the British Museum, London and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>On successful completion of the course, we will be able to:</p>\n\n<p>a) Explore the main trends in the development of Art History, Visual Culture and Museum Studies by accessing the critical essential skills.</p>\n\n<p>b) Evaluate the approaches of artists, art historians, and curators to the field of visual arts and museum studies</p>\n\n<p>c) Explore curatorial practices in the art world</p>\n\n<p>d) Develop the interests for a future training in art curatorial programme and critical museum studies.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Course Prerequisites</strong></p>\n\n<p>None</p>\n\n<p><strong>Modules</strong></p>\n\n<p>Introduction to the Scope and Aims of the Course:</p>\n\n<p>Why Museums?

China&rsquo;s sixteenth-century commercial revolution, in the context of the growing international trade in silver, transformed social and cultural life in every corner of society. Since then, arguments about the distribution of resources and the proper remedy for inequality have been central to political and social movements, especially during the twentieth century. In this course we will examine the economic bases of income inequality in Chinese history, investigate strategies Chinese governments and individuals have used to mitigate rural and urban poverty, and come to appreciate how these economic realities affected people at all levels of Chinese society. Wealth and poverty were experienced differently according to factors including (but not limited to) gender, age, level of education, disability, sexuality, ethnicity, and location. We will read primary sources which illuminate a wide range of perspectives and consider, in conversation with the secondary literature, how to synthesise these materials.

Family lineages developed to be one of the pivotal institutions in organizing local society in late imperial China. These institutions were an important factor in state-society relations, property ownership, infrastructure projects, personal relations, and ritual practice. This course overviews major studies of the historical development of family lineages, its geographic diversity, and their continued existence today as well as their relation to issues of gender, ethnicity, religion, and kinship.<br />\n<br />\nThe first section gives a general overview of Confucian thought with an emphasis on its understanding of kinship and ritual. Section two moves onto historical anthropological studies of the development of family lineages, their related institutional structures (lineage halls) and rituals (ancestor veneration), and their connection to broader social, political, and economic life. Finally, we end the course with ethnographic studies of family lineages in the modern world to consider the impact of the nation-state, urbanization, changes in family dynamics, and transnational communication have had on the lineage.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Section 1: Kinship and Ritual in Confucian Thought and Imperial Power</em></strong><br />\nThis section of the course focuses on Confucian theories of kinship and ritual followed by an overview of the role of these ideas in the structuring of the state and society. The purpose of these theories was different than modern academic works as the aim was to influence how people acted rather than explain what they already were doing. However, they also present an indigenous understanding of these concepts and how the literati elite used them to analyze social issues.<br />\n<br />\n<strong><em>Section 2: Historical Anthropology, Family Lineage, and Local Society</em></strong><br />\nHistorical anthropology emerged in China in response to largely ahistorical orientalist ethnographies of Chinese societies that saw the lineage structure as a monolith and largely drew on existing theories of lineage from European colonies in Africa as well as nationalist histories that presented a unified Chinese culture. In contrast to such studies, historical anthropologists combine fieldwork and local historical documents to analyze the diverse ways that family lineage developed throughout China.

Despite the numerous attacks on traditional culture and the land reform movement that stripped lineages of their land holdings in this period, many lineages throughout China continue to this day. This section focuses on ethnographic studies of how the family lineage has responded to many of the changing social, political, and geographic issues in this period.</p>\n</div></div>"

We will examine Mao&rsquo;s theories and practice of revolution through a thematic lens: not as biographical artifacts but as thought produced by and constitutive of the revolutionary circumstances in the twentieth-century world at large and China in particular.&nbsp; Our aim will be to investigate how three modal terms&mdash;Chinese, Revolutionary, Marxist&mdash;reflect on each other as open questions when Mao Zedong is studied in contextually-embedded and philosophically complex manner.</p>\n\n<p>Situating the world in an intimate dialogic relationship to China, we will ask the questions; was Mao a Marxist? How was Mao&rsquo;s Marxism inflected by his positionality of being Chinese in a revolutionary twentieth-century world? How was Mao&rsquo;s Chineseness influenced by his being a revolutionary in the twentieth-century world? How was Marxism impacted by Mao&rsquo;s articulation of revolution in the twentieth-century world? The readings for this class will mostly be drawn from Mao&rsquo;s own writings, and students will be expected to read these texts intensively, with an open mind. While this course does not require any previous knowledge of China, as an advanced level class, a familiarity with general twentieth-century world history and/or a background in the history of Marxism will be helpful.

That is to say, scrutinizing the beliefs and attitudes that typically go unexamined in a text, drawing attention to the gaps, silences, contradictions, and unspoken impetus that animate written words, but also reading that text through the various registers of its production and circulation&mdash;as an artefact of literary, historical and social conditions that may or may not alter its imagined &ldquo;original&rdquo; context. We are reading Mao, but we will never take him for his word.</p>\n\n<p>I will not take attendance in each class meeting, however, participation in weekly class discussions is a mandatory part of your grade and is necessary for succeeding in the course. If you have circumstances that might affect attendance at a specific class meeting, please let me know ahead of time whenever possible. Flexibility is especially important since Covid is still with us. To protect your privacy, please do not describe any medical situations to me; just inform me that the situation exists and be prepared to provide a doctor&rsquo;s note if requested.</p>\n\n<p>Participation is part of your grade, and should be based on attentive reading, listening, and preparation. Always keep an open mind and be respectful of your classmates and your instructor regardless of what you wish to say, or whether you agree with what has already been said. Being respectful also means that (1) if you have not completed a particular reading, please refrain from commenting on it (2) in the normal course of discussion, if you have just spoken, you should refrain from speaking again until others who wish to contribute have done so (3) contributions to discussion should be based on the readings, lectures, and discussion questions, and should aim to improve our collective understanding of them. In general, please avoid unstructured/unsupported reflections as well as topics that are beyond the scope of the course.</p>\n\n<p>Writing Portfolio</p>\n\n<p>Two-thirds of your final grade for this class will depend on two written pieces that will be thematically related and proceed from each other. The purpose of these pieces is to help you further navigate the landscape of political writing, by interrogating how the processes of (narrative) writing engage with the conveying of &ldquo;information&rdquo; in the quest for coherence, conviction, and accessibility.</p>\n\n<p>The first of these pieces will be a Report on an Investigation of the&nbsp; &lt; &gt; Movement, approx. 5000-6000 words, modeled on Mao&rsquo;s famous Report on the Hunan Peasant Movement. For this first piece, you may choose between reporting on the working conditions of a) campus workers at Ashoka or b) teaching fellows at Ashoka.</p>\n\n<p>The second text is an opinion piece (no longer than 1,000 words) that condenses your longer report into a piece that should function as a call to action.

It takes issues such as inequality, claims to absolute certainty (associated with religion and science), and problems of political representation, and examines theoretical attempts to resolve some of these problems against the historical and cultural realities to be found in Western and Indian democracy. Students will read texts from Plato to the present-day, and consider examples from 18th century France and America, to 21st century India, in order better to understand the theoretical blindspots and the practical potentials of democratic politics in diverse national contexts today<br />\nDemocracy has established itself as the universal norm of political legitimacy, invoked alike to justify the domestic claims of states as well as their international adventures. Yet even at the height of its apparent historical triumph, it faces serious difficulties, both within the established democracies as well as outside them &ndash;engendering disaffection, disappointment, and sometimes outright rejection. This course does not conceive of democracy as a model, nor seek to identify specific norms and values. It is concerned with democratic argument and experience, across different contexts and cultures: with the varieties of political language that have come to be thought of as democratic or anti-democratic. It takes democracy as a problem in modern politics, not as the utopian answer to its riddles. It will draw on a range of thinkers and theoretical arguments, as well as on the varieties of democratic experiences across historical contexts, in order to question the nature of democracy, both as a form of society and as a type of government. Through such questioning, the course hopes to give students a better comprehension of democracy, of its fragilities and its limits, as well as its compelling political and imaginative potency. It is a course in political analysis and argument, which uses history and deploys historical examples to illuminate some of the urgent current predicaments of democracy.</p>\n\n<p>Sunil Khilnani</p>\n\n<p>Thu/Fri: 16.50-18.20</p>\n\n<p>Cap: 50<br />\nEmail: sunil.khilnani@ashoka.edu.in</p>\n</div></div>"

In contemporary imaginations, mountains are essential for the planet&rsquo;s survival and indeed our own physical and mental health. But this was not always the case. In pre-modern Europe, for example, mountains were either ignored or depicted in literature as ugly deformities that scarred the Earth&rsquo;s surface. Why did Europeans think of mountains as ugly? How, when, and why did their aesthetic imaginations change to a point where someone like the celebrated polymath John Ruskin could write that &ldquo;mountains are the beginning and the end of all scenery&rdquo;? How did European perceptions of mountains differ from that of the peoples and traditions of South Asia and elsewhere? And what role has South Asian history played in shaping modern human relationships with the mountains?</p>\n\n<p>This course will take students on a journey from early Asia and pre- modern Europe, to the eighteenth-century when the Alps emerged as objects of adventure, veneration, and scientific experimentation, which in turn, kickstarted two new modern practices&mdash; mountain tourism and the world&rsquo;s most literary sport, mountaineering. This course will then explore how these practices were deeply imbricated with colonialism, nationalism, fascism, and masculinity in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. The course will end in the late twentieth century where it will focus on commercialization of mountaineering and on issues pertaining to non-European modernity. In other words, this course will take students on a journey from a stage in human history where mountains were at best the abode of gods and spirits, and, at worst, ugly deformities, to a stage where there are now &ldquo;traffic jams&rdquo; on Mount Everest.</p>\n\n<p>Focused on the Alps and the Himalaya, this interdisciplinary course will offer a new and exciting vantage point for learning about several fundamental issues and concepts in history and the humanities. Students will learn how scholars in the humanities have rehabilitated mountains as a key terrain where modernity is performed, its limits are exposed, and occasionally transcended. They will also learn about the extent to which our knowledge of the world is framed from the perspective of those who live in the &ldquo;lowlands.&rdquo; Overall, this course will motivate students to think of the history of human interactions with mountains as vital for making sense of what it means to be modern, and, for understanding how we got there.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Tenative Course Syllabus</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><u><strong>Module I: A Cultural History of Mountains</strong></u></p>\n\n<p><u>Week 1: Mountains in Pre-Modern European Imagination and World History</u></p>\n\n<p>Marjorie Hope Nicholson <em>Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory: The Development of the Aesthetics of the Infinite,</em> pp. 34-71.</p>\n\n<p>James Scott <em>The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland South Asia</em> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009), pp. 127-177.</p>\n\n<p><u>Week 2: Mountains in Pre-modern India</u></p>\n\n<p>Kalidasa, <em>Meghaduta</em> excerpts</p>\n\n<p>Kalidasa, <em>Kumarasambhava</em>, excerpts</p>\n\n<p>Nachiket Chanchani <em>Mountain Temples and Temple Mountains: Architecture, Religion and Nature in Central Himalaya</em>, pp. 25-74.</p>\n\n<p><u>Week 3: Scared Mountain in Early to Middle China</u></p>\n\n<p>Wei- Cheng Lin, <em>Building A Sacred Mountain: The Buddhist Architecture of China&rsquo;s Mount Wutai</em>, pp. 51-88.</p>\n\n<p>Wen-shing Chou <em>Mount Wutai Vision of a Sacred Buddhist Mountain</em>, excerpts</p>\n\n<p><u>Week 4: Environment and Aesthetics in Modern Europe</u></p>\n\n<p>Marjorie Hope Nicholson <em>Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory: The Development of The Aesthetics of the Infinite</em> pp. 324-369.</p>\n\n<p>Allen Carlson <em>Nature and Landscape: An Introduction to Environmental Aesthetics,</em> chapter 1, pp. 1-37.</p>\n\n<p>Jon Mathieu, &ldquo;The Sacralization of Mountains in Europe during the Modern Age&rdquo; <em>Mountain Research and Development</em>, 26 (4), pp. 343-349</p>\n\n<p><u>Week 5: Three interpretations of Change in European Attitudes towards the Mountains</u></p>\n\n<p>Marjorie Hope Nicholson <em>Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory: The Development of The Aesthetics of the Infinite </em>pp. 271-323.</p>\n\n<p>Peter Hansen <em>The Summits of the Modern Man: Mountaineering After Enlightenment</em> pp. 30-60.</p>\n\n<p>B.

It surveys various famous as well as not-so-popular cultural traditions and ancient states from across the world, focusing on issues associated with the emergence and development of social, economic and political complexities. We will look into issues like the emergence of sedentism, early villages, the evolution of urban, literate societies, city states, centralized polities and civilizations. We will evaluate the interaction between human and its natural and cultural environment to understand the emergence and functioning of complex societies and ancient states across the globe. For example, how human-environmental interactions as well as the regional socio-political setups helped in production, distribution and consumption of resources? Human-landscape interaction and how changing socio-politics influenced such interaction? To what extent major climatic events influenced culture change and the expression of social complexities? Students should complete the subject with a critical understanding of historical and contemporary theoretical issues in archaeological research and interpretation concerned with the complexities to develop an understanding of various methodologies utilized towards these interpretative ends.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Students will develop a critical understanding of historical and contemporary theoretical issues in archaeological research and interpretation concerned with the complexity</p>\n\n<p>Develop a global perspective on archeological research and practices</p>\n\n<p>Have knowledge of various methodologies utilized towards the interpretation of complexities in archaeological records&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Critically evaluate scientific and theoretical publications</p>\n\n<p>Students will be able to conduct independent/group&nbsp;research projects.</p>\n\n<p>Prepare and deliver oral presentations</p>\n\n<p>Produce publication-quality reports of their own research projects.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This course will be divided into three segments.

        "description": "<h4>The Mughals and the Ocean [HIS-3216] [HIS-3216-1]</h4><div><strong>Faculty Name </strong><div class='cmsDescp'>Mahmood Kooriadathodi [mahmood.kooriadathodi@ashoka.edu.in] ;</div></div><div><strong>Overview</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The Mughal Empire is often understood as a land-based agrarian regime without much interest in the sea. &ldquo;Glory was not won at sea; [it] was bound up with land, and horses racing over the plains,&rdquo; wrote one historian a few decades ago in order to argue that the Mughal and Gujarat sultans were indifferent to the sea. This course revisits this age-old perspective and explores how these two mighty entities, the Mughals and the ocean, faced each other over 300 years.</p>\n\n<p>For the Mughals, the ocean provided a diverse array of possibilities. From Africa to Arabia and the rest of Asia, the Indian Ocean brought them many unprecedented commodities, communities, animals, ideas and institutions, many of which affected and effected their future course. Utilizing vast horizons of such possibilities, they sought ways to quench their imperial thirst in a potential Age of Mughal Exploration. They knew well that they could not present themselves as conquerors or rulers of the world (with such titles as &ldquo;jahangir&rdquo;, &ldquo;shahjahan&rdquo; or &ldquo;alamgir&rdquo;) without confronting the ocean that covered two-thirds of the earth&rsquo;s surface. The oceanic border was never an end to the imperial venture, rather it was an integral part of their expansionist and universalist ambitions and a beginning of a different Mughal realm. Their chronicles, memoirs, court records and imperial orders reflect this endeavour, although a majority of historians have neglected this so far.</p>\n\n<p>The intellectual, ideological, and messianic take on the ocean was accompanied by many more pragmatic interests. With diverse economic, religious, cultural, political and even personal demands, the Mughals invested heavily in maritime trade and travel. Many royal ladies, nobles, courtiers, scribes, and scholars crossed the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. Akbar himself commissioned a large ship and his one courtier compared ships to horses and camels in the battlefields. His wife, and future ruler Jahangir&rsquo;s mother, Mariam Zamani (aka Jodha Bai) owned the largest ship of their time. His aunt and wife, together with a large entourage, went across the Arabian Sea on a pilgrimage to Mecca. All these moves were furthered through the maritime involvement of many traditional landlubber groups like the Rajputs and Jats along with the seagoing communities such as Gujaratis, Bengalis, Marathas, Tamils, Dakhinis and Konkanis. During this period, they also combatted the rise and fall of certain European maritime empires, especially the Portuguese, the Dutch and finally the English.</p>\n\n<p>An oceanic gaze at the Mughal Empire thus gives us a completely different perspective on Indian, Mughal, South Asian and Indian Ocean histories. This fresh look from the sea helps us understand the size and breadth of the Empire&rsquo;s maritime ventures, especially in comparison with the contemporary regimes of the Safavids and Ottomans in the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, Aceh, Ayutthaya, Banten and Mataram in the Bay of Bengal. The global historical perspective also helps us go beyond the frameworks of European companies and sources, which a few historians have explored in the last three decades.</p>\n\n<p>Through such episodes in the Mughal and Oceanic histories, the course will mainly focus on such themes as ideas, infrastructures, humans, animals and objects. Within these areas, it would zoom onto a few Mughal women who were the biggest risk-takers in the Empire with their extraordinary ventures into maritime trade and travel. Their formidable roles in &ldquo;bringing the ocean home&rdquo; through their everyday roles as traders, travellers, shipowners, etc. are yet to be told collectively.</p>\n\n<p>The seminar-cum-lecture course will train students to explore primary sources on their own, articulate their observations as scholarly arguments, and write academically from a global (historical) perspective. From the third week onward, the course will have four tracks: short lectures; writing short notes on primary sources; reading primary and secondary sources; and, discussion of readings and students&rsquo; writings.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>On the successful completion of this course, you will be able to</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Understand the Mughal and Indian Ocean histories from comparative and connected perspectives.</li>\n\t<li>Approach any major political entities, and human history at large, from an oceanic perspective instead of being locked conceptually by land.</li>\n\t<li>Develop advanced skills in reading Mughal sources critically, especially for research and writing.</li>\n\t<li>Acquire proficiency in academic writing with a focus on precision, comprehensiveness and commitment to primary and secondary sources.</li>\n\t<li>Conceive, write and present a research paper from a global (historical) perspective.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This course is a lecture-cum-seminar. The instructor would give short lectures at the beginning of each class, but readings and discussions are the central components of this course.

The course has a comparative edge, and will push the students to compare the Ottoman empire with the other contemporaneous empires, in particular the Safavids and the Mughals.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Course Content:</p>\n\n<p>Unit 1: (Week 1-2): Asia Minor Before the Ottomans: An Overview</p>\n\n<p>Unit 2: (week 3-4): The Early Ottomans: The idea of frontier and gazi.</p>\n\n<p>Unit 3: (week 5-6): Disintegration and Reintegration: Fall of Constantinople /Conquest of Istanbul (1453).</p>\n\n<p>Unit 4 (week 7-8): Centralisation and its discontents: key institutions</p>\n\n<p>Unit 5 (week 9-10): Harem and Imperial Sovereignty</p>\n\n<p>Unit 6 (week 11-12): Interpretations of Ottoman Economy</p>\n\n<p>Unit 7 (week 13): Concluding Remarks on early modern Empires and global history</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Suggested Readings</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unit 1 (week 1-2);</strong> The objective of this unit is to acquaint the students with the political culture in the region before the emergence of the Ottoman empire</p>\n\n<p>Albert Hourani, The Emergence of the Modern Middle East (London: Macmillan, 1981)</p>\n\n<p>Speros Jr. Vryonis, The Decline of Medieval Hellinism in Asia Minor and the Process of Islamization from the Eleventh through the Fifteenth Century (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1971), pp.69-133.</p>\n\n<p>David Morgan, Medieval Persia, 1040-1797 (London: Routledge, 1988), 25-33</p>\n\n<p>S.

Starting with Sir Isaac Newton in the 17th century we will travel up to the middle of the 20th century.

Or on a terrain? How are people produced by such mapping? What anxieties drive the imperial cartographic impulse? What pressures does terra nullis exert in situ? What do the bodies produced in mapped territories look like? What bodies exist in unmapped terrains? What is the relationship between wonder/amazement, and control/annihilation? Where do we locate ourselves as scholars reading these maps? What maps are visible when we visit the landscape? How are narratives produced against maps? How are histories made visible in terrain?</p>\n\n<p>These questions will guide us as we traverse a theoretical terrain of writings on space and territory, and situate ourselves in specific historical moments of imperial mastery over space. We will cover a lot of ground temporally but our geographic focus will be South and East Asia. In this class we will develop skills in reading and understanding the genre of the academic monograph; in understanding how they relate to each other; and in analyzing the theoretical and methodological bases and trends of these works.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Summarize academic monographs in South and East Asian studies and introduce salient points in notes and in speech.</p>\n\n<p>Be able to draw connections between works to gain an overview of scholarly and historiographical debates.</p>\n\n<p>Be able to trace theoretical or methodological trends across multiple empirical contexts.</p>\n\n<p>Analyze and present in writing your interpretation of the role of space and place in a geographical region relevant to your work or interest.</p>\n\n<p>Learn the skills of co-writing and co-presenting to gain a sense of how cooperative work can integrate intellectual property as well as collective clarity.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>You are not required to purchase any materials for this course.

If you have circumstances that might affect attendance at a specific class meeting, please let me know ahead of time whenever possible. Flexibility is especially important since Covid is still with us. To protect your privacy, please do not describe any medical situations to me; just inform me that the situation exists and be prepared to provide a doctor&rsquo;s note if requested.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Participation is part of your grade, and should be based on attentive reading, listening, and preparation. Participation can take many forms. Always keep an open mind and be respectful of your classmates and your instructor regardless of what you wish to say, or whether you agree with what has already been said. Being respectful also means that (1) if you have not completed a particular reading, please refrain from commenting on it (2) in the normal course of discussion, if you have just spoken, you should refrain from speaking again until others who wish to contribute have done so (3) contributions to discussion should be based on the readings, lectures, and discussion questions, and should aim to improve our collective understanding of them. In general, please avoid unstructured/unsupported reflections as well as topics that are beyond the scope of the course.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Class lead:</p>\n\n<p>One student per week (both Tuesday and Thursday) will introduce the assigned readings for that week (~10 mins) and facilitate discussion for the rest of the class. Try to keep your presentation to under ten minutes, and use the time to provide a short summary of one or two of the assigned texts, and present to the class your own questions and ideas about the theme through the readings. This exercise will help you condense the readings to their core argument and thereby facilitate review before assignments are due. For this reason, it makes sense to approach every set of readings with a few basic questions: who is the author? What is his or her background? What kind of audience are they addressing? And what is the aim of the text? Is it a purely technical piece of writing or does it raise (or hide?) important political questions? These questions are very basic, but they will help you to structure your contribution to the class. If you would like to additionally discuss reading material or resources not on the reading list in your presentation, please feel free to discuss your ideas for the presentation with me beforehand. Following the week&rsquo;s discussion, the class lead will collate all the notes for the assigned readings, to structure them into an annotated entry for each text we have read.</p>\n\n<p>Carto-paper:</p>\n\n<p>This assignment will be a 5500-6000 word (Times New Roman 12 pt. font, double-spaced, not including footnotes and bibliography) investigation of a single primary source relevant to the field of cartography, broadly construed: this can be a specific map, a surveyor&rsquo;s field diary, an object history of a technical instrument, etc. Feel free to discuss your ideas or adjustments, if you prefer, for this project with me beforehand. You may also turn this into a collaborative project if you wish. Your carto-paper is due 11.59 pm May 14, by email to me. We will be discussing two drafts of your paper as a class. These two drafts are due on Monday 11.59 pm February 20 and April 3, by email. Following your submissions, we will intensively workshop everyone&rsquo;s paper as a group. In these group discussions, you will be expected to have read your peers&rsquo; work (as you would when you will attend conferences, workshops, and panel discussions), and offer constructive feedback to help your peers make progress on their projects. Your participation in these discussions will count towards your final grade for the carto-paper.</p>\n\n<p>These essays are an important way to develop your writing skills&mdash;particularly the formation of a clear and logical argument, the mobilization of evidence, and the quality of prose. Your essays are intended to help you build the specific skill of making a historical argument, and to that end they should be erudite, specific, supportable and argumentative&mdash;not an unstructured reflection, opinion, or summary. They must refer, when needed, to the readings with citations.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Late submissions will not be accepted. If you anticipate that for any reason you will be unable to make these deadlines, please email me at least 48 hours in advance for an extension.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Your essays must aim to illuminate the texts you have chosen to discuss, rather than simply critique them or identify the gaps in the knowledge of the authors. The effectiveness of your arguments will rest on your plausible articulation of positions and paradigms of thinking that you may be unfamiliar or even disagree with. Thus, both your essays and the feedback you offer your peers should attempt to first reconstruct the carefully considered and rigorously formulated thoughts and arguments of the authors you are reading, before seeking to push that comprehension in a new direction.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/536ea63f-1411-4b82-9f68-3464d5362257.docx' download='Borderlands 2023 syllabus and weekly schedule.docx'>Borderlands 2023 syllabus and weekly schedule.docx</a></td></tr></table></div></div>"

We will consider what questions these problems raise for historians&#39; use of textual sources by looking at writing as a social, material, and political act. What were the symbolic meanings attributed to writings that most people could not understand? What practical uses could writing serve? How did access to writing intersect with other social hierarchies, like gender and class? Beginning with the invention of writing in the Yellow River region, we will discuss problems such as: the relationship between speech and writing; changes in writing materials; writing for display and writing for use; censorship; Chinese characters in non-Chinese societies; and debates over script reform.</p>\n\n<p>The written assessment for this class will build towards a final research paper on a topic of the students&#39; choice.</p>\n</div></div>"

It will focus on some of the dominant traditions of historical writing, and the internal dialogues within the traditions. It will move from positivism to critical theory, from Marxism to the Annales, from the French historical tradition to English social history, from Foucault&rsquo;s discursive turn to Michel de Certeau&rsquo;s focus on everyday practice. Through this journey, we will reflect on some of the binaries that often shape historical thinking &ndash;&ndash; the questions of history and myth, certainty and ambiguity, objectivity and prejudice, truth and falsehood &ndash;&ndash; and see how these notions are questioned and rethought over time.</p>\n\n<p>If historians in the nineteenth century established some of the founding premises of the historian&rsquo;s craft, the &lsquo;critical turn&rsquo; from the 1970s has powerfully questioned many of these assumptions, underlining the complex nature of historical practice. It has persuaded historians to ask: what does it mean to enter the archive and mine the traces of the past, to read the record, to see and represent, to narrate, and to write a story based on evidence? This course will explore what this critical turn has meant to the writing of history, how it has forced historians to question earlier frames, and opened up new worlds of research.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>THEMES AND LECTURES:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Introduction: On Reading History</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>I: MODERNITY AND HISTORICAL KNOWEDGE</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>1) Ranke, Acton and the Shaping of the Historical Discipline</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; Readings:</strong></p>\n\n<p>G.

It is comprehensive introduction to a way of analyzing and researching global politics and international relations that takes gender seriously as a category of analysis.&nbsp; More specifically, it is concerned with how ideas of war, peace, sovereignty, violence, foreign policy, governance and political economy are sustained by specific masculinities and femininities, and how these particular gender constructions impact on the lives of particular groups of men and women. Set against this, the aim of the course is mainly threefold: firstly, to (re)introduce how the discipline has traditionally thought about war and peace; secondly, to reveal the gendered constructions and inequalities that mark the traditional scholarship; and thirdly, to evaluate the specific contribution that feminist critiques have made as part of the so-called &lsquo;Critical Turn&rsquo; in IR. Gender is understood here not as a synonym for &lsquo;woman&rsquo; but as a hierarchical coding of masculinity and femininity that pervades social relations and institutional practices, with systemic (though not deterministic) effects on inequalities. Gender meanings and practices permeate our lives, and a closer look at these processes is more illuminating than many anticipate, with relevance and implications for who we are, how we think, and how we act &ndash; as individuals, groups, communities and nation-states.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><ul>\n\t<li>Understand the landscape of feminist international relations thought and challenge gender-blind and gendered approaches to global politics</li>\n\t<li>Complicate understandings of global politics by identifying relationship between global crises and global gender(ed) divisions</li>\n\t<li>Appreciate that the international is personal and the personal is international and&nbsp; recognize the necessity and complexity of taking gender seriously in global politics.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Pre-requisite- a 100 level introductory IR course.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>It is a continuous process- Class presentations, mid-term assessment, group project and end term assessment.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>There are three excused absences allowed for the semester.</p>\n</div></div>"

Since this concern links two concept groups, this course doubles as a stylized and brief introduction to the literature on foreign aid and democratization. In democratization (Part I), we will consider the type of foreign interventions, the drivers of democratization, the special role of elections and the varieties of authoritarianism. In Foreign aid (Part II), we will cover the types of foreign aid, the efficacy debate, the modalities of democracy aid, the incentive of aid donors and recipients and donor switching.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>After the theoretical overview, we consider a practical approach to existing political constraints (Part III), as articulated in my book, Liberalization at the Margins. We skim the empirics and put more emphasis on the case studies of the aid-democratization dynamic for Egypt, Fiji, and Myanmar. We conclude by considering the policy implications of such strategies with an emphasis on the authoritarian backlash (and authoritarian strategies for international law.)</p>\n\n<p>The attached syllabus is obviously a draft.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Through the course, students should be able to 1) identify the major issues and debates in foreign aid, 2) analyse the costs and benefits of various modalities of democracy aid, and 3) consider the policy implications of democracy promotion. Students also have the opportunity, through the term essay, to specialize on the aid dynamics of a given country and understand why democracy promotion frequently fails. As a bonus, students get a sense of the background work that goes into the writing of a book, They may appreciate (or not!) that what you see the finished product &ndash; the book - is merely the tip iceberg. It is the part that is underwater and not immediately obvious where the real labor lies.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a course on current events.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>I establish the course pre-requisites here.</p>\n\n<p>A&nbsp;prospective student has&nbsp;to take one of the following courses from either department&nbsp;in order to be eligible.</p>\n\n<p>From Political Science:</p>\n\n<p>Introduction to Comparative Politics</p>\n\n<p>Quantitative Research Methods</p>\n\n<p>Qualitative Research Methods</p>\n\n<p>From International Relations:</p>\n\n<p>Introduction to International Relations</p>\n\n<p>Theories and Issues of International Relations</p>\n\n<p>Any 2000 level IR elective.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The relative weightage is stubject to change.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Final exam &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(30)</p>\n\n<p>Midterm exam &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(30)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Class Attendance&nbsp; &amp; participation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10)</p>\n\n<p>Student Presentation 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(20)</p>\n\n<p>Student Presentation 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10)</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>You are expected to show up for class.

We will examine Mao&rsquo;s theories and practice of revolution through a thematic lens: not as biographical artifacts but as thought produced by and constitutive of the revolutionary circumstances in the twentieth-century world at large and China in particular.&nbsp; Our aim will be to investigate how three modal terms&mdash;Chinese, Revolutionary, Marxist&mdash;reflect on each other as open questions when Mao Zedong is studied in contextually-embedded and philosophically complex manner.</p>\n\n<p>Situating the world in an intimate dialogic relationship to China, we will ask the questions; was Mao a Marxist? How was Mao&rsquo;s Marxism inflected by his positionality of being Chinese in a revolutionary twentieth-century world? How was Mao&rsquo;s Chineseness influenced by his being a revolutionary in the twentieth-century world? How was Marxism impacted by Mao&rsquo;s articulation of revolution in the twentieth-century world? The readings for this class will mostly be drawn from Mao&rsquo;s own writings, and students will be expected to read these texts intensively, with an open mind. While this course does not require any previous knowledge of China, as an advanced level class, a familiarity with general twentieth-century world history and/or a background in the history of Marxism will be helpful. Students with prior background in neither will be expected to learn on a very steep curve.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Read intertextually and understand literary productions as artefacts of historical and social construction.</p>\n\n<p>Summarize academic monographs in East Asian studies and introduce salient points in&nbsp;notes and in speech.</p>\n\n<p>Be able to draw connections between works to gain an overview of scholarly and historiographical debates.</p>\n\n<p>Be able to trace theoretical or methodological trends across multiple empirical contexts.</p>\n\n<p>Learn the skills of co-writing and co-presenting to gain a sense of how cooperative work can integrate intellectual property as well as collective clarity.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>You are not required to purchase any materials for this course.

That is to say, scrutinizing the beliefs and attitudes that typically go unexamined in a text, drawing attention to the gaps, silences, contradictions, and unspoken impetus that animate written words, but also reading that text through the various registers of its production and circulation&mdash;as an artefact of literary, historical and social conditions that may or may not alter its imagined &ldquo;original&rdquo; context. We are reading Mao, but we will never take him for his word.</p>\n\n<p>I will not take attendance in each class meeting, however, participation in weekly class discussions is a mandatory part of your grade and is necessary for succeeding in the course. If you have circumstances that might affect attendance at a specific class meeting, please let me know ahead of time whenever possible. Flexibility is especially important since Covid is still with us. To protect your privacy, please do not describe any medical situations to me; just inform me that the situation exists and be prepared to provide a doctor&rsquo;s note if requested.</p>\n\n<p>Participation is part of your grade, and should be based on attentive reading, listening, and preparation. Always keep an open mind and be respectful of your classmates and your instructor regardless of what you wish to say, or whether you agree with what has already been said. Being respectful also means that (1) if you have not completed a particular reading, please refrain from commenting on it (2) in the normal course of discussion, if you have just spoken, you should refrain from speaking again until others who wish to contribute have done so (3) contributions to discussion should be based on the readings, lectures, and discussion questions, and should aim to improve our collective understanding of them. In general, please avoid unstructured/unsupported reflections as well as topics that are beyond the scope of the course.</p>\n\n<p>Writing Portfolio</p>\n\n<p>Two-thirds of your final grade for this class will depend on two written pieces that will be thematically related and proceed from each other. The purpose of these pieces is to help you further navigate the landscape of political writing, by interrogating how the processes of (narrative) writing engage with the conveying of &ldquo;information&rdquo; in the quest for coherence, conviction, and accessibility.</p>\n\n<p>The first of these pieces will be a Report on an Investigation of the&nbsp; &lt; &gt; Movement, approx. 5000-6000 words, modeled on Mao&rsquo;s famous Report on the Hunan Peasant Movement. For this first piece, you may choose between reporting on the working conditions of a) campus workers at Ashoka or b) teaching fellows at Ashoka.</p>\n\n<p>The second text is an opinion piece (no longer than 1,000 words) that condenses your longer report into a piece that should function as a call to action. Unlike the first piece, where your stated purpose is an &ldquo;investigation&rdquo;, your purpose in this second piece is to craft an appeal.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that you have the option of writing both the Report and the op-ed as a team project, but that the requirements will change accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>For both pieces, you may choose to conduct interviews in person, speak to campus &ldquo;experts&rdquo;, read theoretical texts or works providing historical background. The methodology is entirely up to you, but you are encouraged discuss your thinking and writing process with me through a series of progress meetings. These meetings will count for ten percent of your final grade.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/9132cd31-e21b-4d9d-b123-10a0f568bf49.docx' download='An Interpretive History of Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Revolution.docx'>An Interpretive History of Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Revolution.docx</a></td></tr></table></div></div>"

While it is well established that male bodies make up the vast majority of decision-makers and participants in quotidian electoral politics, the same logic applies to contexts affected by conflict and war. Conventionally, male bodies are considered to be at the forefront of decision-making about whether to go to war, and on the frontlines of said wars as fighters.</p>\n\n<p>In the last few decades, however, these constructions of masculinity and femininity in conflict have come to be questioned. Instead, the understanding that gender affects the way in which we see and make sense of the world around us &ndash;&nbsp;and that men and women experience and affect wartime dynamics differently &ndash; has come front and center. In the same spirit, we will focus on the role of women in political decision-making and participation; their role both as perpetrators of violence as combatants (and terrorists), as victims and as survivors of male-victimizing atrocities; the militarization of gendered bodies and the impact of gender-based violence in armed conflict.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we will reflect on the gendered aspects of women&rsquo;s restructuring of economies in male absence, their resistance to political violence, and their role in peacekeeping and rebuilding societies after war. As we cover each theme, we will pay particular attention to what feminists have described as intersectionality and the continuum of violence, from the &ldquo;private&rdquo; to the &ldquo;public&rdquo; sphere, from the militarization of everyday living to overt violent conflict.</p>\n</div></div>"

        "description": "<h4>Making Meaning: Qualitative Methods in IR and Political Science [IR-2042/ POL-2103] [IR-2042/ POL-2103-1]</h4><div><strong>Faculty Name </strong><div class='cmsDescp'>Amit Jai Pal Julka [amit.julka@ashoka.edu.in] ;</div></div><div><strong>Overview</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Introduction</p>\n\n<p>Usually, methods are seen as the boring side of research. On top of that, qualitative/interpretivist methods are often viewed as &lsquo;airy-fairy&rsquo;, soft, &amp; inconclusive as opposed to the solid, robust &amp; conclusive nature of quantitative research. This course aims to demolish all these myths and drive home the following points &mdash; qualitative/interpretivist method research is fun, challenging, nuanced, and as &lsquo;robust&rsquo; as conventional positivist research. Furthermore, the course is rooted in the belief that the binaries of qualitative/quantitative or interpretivist/positivist are not only exaggerated, but also unhelpful.</p>\n\n<p>Now, given the enormity of the tasks at hand, the course will be challenging (which is not the same as difficult). Which means, that you will be required to read a lot, reflect, engage, critique, and apply. You have been warned.</p>\n\n<p>Objectives</p>\n\n<p>The aims of the course are fourfold:</p>\n\n<p>First, to not just study methods/methodology in instrumentalist terms, but to root ourselves in philosophy of science - so we start with Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos to understand the nature of scientific inquiry. Then, we try to overturn all of them by reading Feyerabend&#39;s provocative treatise &#39;Against Method&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the module covers foundational literature on how to select one&#39;s case studies, along with basics such as conceptualization and operationalization. After that, we deep-dive into the methods themselves - discourse analysis, visual analysis, ethnography, quantitative text analysis, interviews etc.</p>\n\n<p>Third, the module&#39;s aim is also to acquaint you with exemplars (mostly) of qualitative research from Pol Sci/IR - to show you how things have been done, and to provoke you into thinking how they could have been done better. For instance, we see how James Scott&#39;s ethnography uncovered micropolitics of resistance in Southeast Asia, or how Carol Cohn stumbled upon the masculinized/sexualized world of defence intellectuals in the United States.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, we try to get our hands dirty and do some discourse analysis ourselves. So, a workshop will be organized where students try analyzing a text of their choice - which could be a film, piece of music, novel, or a government record.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>See above</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Week 1: What is social reality?</p>\n\n<p>Monday:<br />\nIntroduction<br />\n<br />\nWednesday:<br />\nE.H.

Or on a terrain? How are people produced by such mapping? What anxieties drive the imperial cartographic impulse? What pressures does terra nullis exert in situ? What do the bodies produced in mapped territories look like? What bodies exist in unmapped terrains? What is the relationship between wonder/amazement, and control/annihilation? Where do we locate ourselves as scholars reading these maps? What maps are visible when we visit the landscape? How are narratives produced against maps? How are histories made visible in terrain?</p>\n\n<p>These questions will guide us as we traverse a theoretical terrain of writings on space and territory, and situate ourselves in specific historical moments of imperial mastery over space. We will cover a lot of ground temporally but our geographic focus will be South and East Asia. In this class we will develop skills in reading and understanding the genre of the academic monograph; in understanding how they relate to each other; and in analyzing the theoretical and methodological bases and trends of these works.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Summarize academic monographs in South and East Asian studies and introduce salient points in notes and in speech.</p>\n\n<p>Be able to draw connections between works to gain an overview of scholarly and historiographical debates.</p>\n\n<p>Be able to trace theoretical or methodological trends across multiple empirical contexts.</p>\n\n<p>Analyze and present in writing your interpretation of the role of space and place in a geographical region relevant to your work or interest.</p>\n\n<p>Learn the skills of co-writing and co-presenting to gain a sense of how cooperative work can integrate intellectual property as well as collective clarity.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>You are not required to purchase any materials for this course. All readings will be provided in PDF via email.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Assessment &amp; Assignments:</p>\n\n<p>40% - Leading weekly discussion in class and participating in class discussions</p>\n\n<p>60% - Carto-Paper (Optional Team Project)</p>\n\n<p>Attendance, Participation and Discussion Etiquette :</p>\n\n<p>I will not take attendance in each class meeting, however, participation in weekly class discussions is a mandatory part of your grade and is necessary for succeeding in the course. If you have circumstances that might affect attendance at a specific class meeting, please let me know ahead of time whenever possible. Flexibility is especially important since Covid is still with us. To protect your privacy, please do not describe any medical situations to me; just inform me that the situation exists and be prepared to provide a doctor&rsquo;s note if requested.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Participation is part of your grade, and should be based on attentive reading, listening, and preparation. Participation can take many forms. Always keep an open mind and be respectful of your classmates and your instructor regardless of what you wish to say, or whether you agree with what has already been said. Being respectful also means that (1) if you have not completed a particular reading, please refrain from commenting on it (2) in the normal course of discussion, if you have just spoken, you should refrain from speaking again until others who wish to contribute have done so (3) contributions to discussion should be based on the readings, lectures, and discussion questions, and should aim to improve our collective understanding of them. In general, please avoid unstructured/unsupported reflections as well as topics that are beyond the scope of the course.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Class lead:</p>\n\n<p>One student per week (both Tuesday and Thursday) will introduce the assigned readings for that week (~10 mins) and facilitate discussion for the rest of the class. Try to keep your presentation to under ten minutes, and use the time to provide a short summary of one or two of the assigned texts, and present to the class your own questions and ideas about the theme through the readings. This exercise will help you condense the readings to their core argument and thereby facilitate review before assignments are due. For this reason, it makes sense to approach every set of readings with a few basic questions: who is the author? What is his or her background? What kind of audience are they addressing? And what is the aim of the text? Is it a purely technical piece of writing or does it raise (or hide?) important political questions? These questions are very basic, but they will help you to structure your contribution to the class. If you would like to additionally discuss reading material or resources not on the reading list in your presentation, please feel free to discuss your ideas for the presentation with me beforehand. Following the week&rsquo;s discussion, the class lead will collate all the notes for the assigned readings, to structure them into an annotated entry for each text we have read.</p>\n\n<p>Carto-paper:</p>\n\n<p>This assignment will be a 5500-6000 word (Times New Roman 12 pt. font, double-spaced, not including footnotes and bibliography) investigation of a single primary source relevant to the field of cartography, broadly construed: this can be a specific map, a surveyor&rsquo;s field diary, an object history of a technical instrument, etc. Feel free to discuss your ideas or adjustments, if you prefer, for this project with me beforehand. You may also turn this into a collaborative project if you wish. Your carto-paper is due 11.59 pm May 14, by email to me. We will be discussing two drafts of your paper as a class. These two drafts are due on Monday 11.59 pm February 20 and April 3, by email. Following your submissions, we will intensively workshop everyone&rsquo;s paper as a group. In these group discussions, you will be expected to have read your peers&rsquo; work (as you would when you will attend conferences, workshops, and panel discussions), and offer constructive feedback to help your peers make progress on their projects. Your participation in these discussions will count towards your final grade for the carto-paper.</p>\n\n<p>These essays are an important way to develop your writing skills&mdash;particularly the formation of a clear and logical argument, the mobilization of evidence, and the quality of prose. Your essays are intended to help you build the specific skill of making a historical argument, and to that end they should be erudite, specific, supportable and argumentative&mdash;not an unstructured reflection, opinion, or summary. They must refer, when needed, to the readings with citations.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Late submissions will not be accepted. If you anticipate that for any reason you will be unable to make these deadlines, please email me at least 48 hours in advance for an extension.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Your essays must aim to illuminate the texts you have chosen to discuss, rather than simply critique them or identify the gaps in the knowledge of the authors. The effectiveness of your arguments will rest on your plausible articulation of positions and paradigms of thinking that you may be unfamiliar or even disagree with. Thus, both your essays and the feedback you offer your peers should attempt to first reconstruct the carefully considered and rigorously formulated thoughts and arguments of the authors you are reading, before seeking to push that comprehension in a new direction.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/536ea63f-1411-4b82-9f68-3464d5362257.docx' download='Borderlands 2023 syllabus and weekly schedule.docx'>Borderlands 2023 syllabus and weekly schedule.docx</a></td></tr></table></div></div>"

The introductory concepts (that we will study in this course) are easy to understand, but are powerful and apply in many contexts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The applications to various fields are too numerous to mention. Lets&nbsp; just say that the modern world would not be so modern without the application of linear algebra, &nbsp;nor would&nbsp;our understanding of the universe would be where it is now.&nbsp;And neither would mathematics be as developed if all kinds of mathematical objects are not studied using linear algebra. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>However, the course is mostly mathematical. Applications will be to understand some mathematical objects.The subject unfolds slowly over the semester.&nbsp;As you work through the semester, you learn how to extend your intuition of&nbsp;two and&nbsp;three dimensions to work in an n-dimensional space. At the same time, as the title of the main textbook reflects,&nbsp; this course may be regarded as an&nbsp;introduction to abstract mathematics. So you learn how to apply logical arguments to prove statements.</p>\n\n<p>Its a busy course requiring a lot of effort and enthusiasm. You have to be young and energetic and want&nbsp;to learn a lot very quickly. But why&nbsp;am I saying this?&nbsp;You are Ashoka students.&nbsp;Of course you are young and energetic and want to learn a lot very quickly!</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The syllabus in the course handbook is as follows.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong>&nbsp;Real&nbsp;vector spaces, subspaces, spanning sets, basis sets, dimension of a vector space.&nbsp; Solution of a system of linear equations.&nbsp;Row space and column space of a matrix, rank of a matrix, elementary row and column operations of a matrix.&nbsp;Inversion of square matrices, rank factorization of a matrix.&nbsp;Properties of determinants.&nbsp;Linear transformations, range and null space of a linear transformation, rank-nullity theorem.&nbsp;Matrix representation of a linear transformation.&nbsp;Inner product spaces, normed linear spaces, examples of different normed linear spaces, orthonormal basis sets.&nbsp;Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, characteristic polynomials.&nbsp;Spectral theorem for real symmetric matrices.&nbsp;Singular value decompositions.</p>\n\n<p>We are likely to do all the above for vector spaces over Complex numbers. The proof of the Spectral theorem is&nbsp;a little easier for this.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Text book:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Isaiah Lankham, Bruno Nachtergaele and Anne Schilling,&nbsp;Linear Algebra - As an Introduction to Abstract Mathematics, Free online text available from:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~anne/linear_algebra/</p>\n\n<p>We will cover most of the book including Appendix A.</p>\n\n<p>The course material is roughly from this book, but I may deviate considerably.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional References.</strong></p>\n\n<p>You may find the following books helpful as supplementary reading in case something is not clear from the textbook.</p>\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;S. H. Friedberg, A. J. Insel and L. E. Spence,&nbsp;Linear algebra, Pearson, 2015. (Good book for extensive explanations, lots of problems for you to make sure you have understood the topics.)</p>\n\n<p>2. P. Bogacki, Linear Algebra, Concepts and Applications, AMS/MAA Textbooks, Vol 47, 2019. (Good for matrix examples.)</p>\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;Gilbert Strang,&nbsp;Linear Algebra and its Applications, (4th or 5th edition). (The classic textbook. Covers a lot. At some point in your career, you should become familiar with it. Lectures are also available for these.)</p>\n\n<p>4. T. Shifrin and M. R. Adams, Linear Algebra: A Geometric Approach, WH Freeman (2nd edition). (Nice book with a geometric flavor. Great for gaining intuition.)</p>\n\n<p>5. Wikipedia is great for mathematics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>6. I will hand out a problem set which includes (most of) Professor Bhatia&#39;s problems from a few years ago.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Computer algebra system.</strong></p>\n\n<p>We will make extensive use of the computer algebra system SAGE. In the real world, Linear Algebra is done using many different numerical packages. However, we use a symbolic algebra package. SAGE&nbsp;is available at:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sagemath.org\">www.sagemath.org</a></p>\n\n<p>Please install it before coming to class. Write to me in case of difficulties. There is a possibility of using it online too, but that has become very slow and irritating. It has to be used as a last resort.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>There will be 10 quizzes (in lecture) (on occasion replaced by&nbsp;Assignments) (33.33% of grade),&nbsp; 2 midterms (in lecture) (33.33%) and a take home final (33.33%).&nbsp; Midterms 1 and 2 are&nbsp; in-class exams.&nbsp;More details will be provided on the first day of class. A max of 2 missed quiz scores can be replaced by average of rest. &nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>While there is no formal requirement to attend lectures and DS sessions, it may be a good idea to do so because we may deviate or add to the material in the textbook which may show up on quizzes and tests. In general, its easier to read the book when you&nbsp;know&nbsp;whats going on in the lectures. Further, there will be no makeup exams (Quizzes or midterms) and these will happen during class times. Usually for math courses expect to spend a minimum of 4-5 hours outside of class every week to keep up.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

Be it on an interest-based website or platform, or the social media platforms that are constantly pushing towards a stringer visual language. As the schism between the written word and visuals are challenged, often the text is now the new image. In these times visual articulation is making a strong space for itself in every form of information or content, be it journalism, daily expression and even academics. In a post Covid world, much of the health information has moved to a visual plane, similar to explaining economics to the common man amidst the turbulence, or the Refugee crisis in Syria, and many others. The visual approach is now the new language of communication across the spectrum to make an engaged form of communication, information and understanding.</p>\n\n<p>With the advent of social media and personalization of content consumption, visual communication has been fast and consistently evolving. From the black board in the classroom to the white board animations on social media, from informative visual pamphlets to educational comics, the blending of the academic information and the visual articulation, a new platform for educational dissemination and discussion has emerged both in the digital and analogue spaces.</p>\n\n<p>The new forms of information, whether through print or the digital, through picture books to animations to pocket sized visual bites on the mobile, the new visual based forms have found both audience and acceptance. This has now brought forth a demand for content makers and practitioners who are willing to engage with it visually in terms of practice. In the visual world we live now, it is a form with a moving language now blending with technology. This course will blend these influences into ones&rsquo; own academic major to create content that helps demystifying the respective discipline through visual content lime comics, graphic narratives, zines and basic animations to reach out to a wider audience.</p>\n\n<p>Visual led approach for awareness building, information sharing and education has now evolved both as a form and a medium that is now used in every discipline, as an independent genre both in the online and offline worlds. Today the visual form has drawn inspiration and been influenced by multiple disciplines like painting, filmmaking, animations, the printed text, gaming pushing it to the next gen ux/ui platforms. It&rsquo;s this multi-disciplinary influence and framework this course seeks to work with.</p>\n\n<p><u>This course seeks to blend one&rsquo;s academic interest with the omnipresent visual world through storytelling, visual narratives, blending academics and practice with a research led inter-disciplinary approach.</u></p>\n\n<p><strong>What this course is about</strong></p>\n\n<p>Exploring possibilities of visual based information dissemination, visual discussion and engagement, this course plans to engage with extending ones&rsquo; academic learning to visual based practice. Exploring the genre as a tool and a form that can be incorporated in one&rsquo;s individual academic discipline. This approach can help the students in articulating their learnings, research and storytelling in multi-disciplinary formats. In these times when visual storytelling is a pervasive and a popular form of information, opinion and communication, the practice-based engagement will help students open up their learnings to a multi-disciplinary articulation as new age academic content creators.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Course Modules:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The preliminary module of this course of 2 weeks will be a curated overview of the published, popular and the prevalent and emerging forms of visual based information through different genres and mediums. The idea would be exploring the diversity of practice across the globe and the processes involved in content creation of such types. The idea here will be to discuss the forms and works to bring new practice-based influences and ideas, their working process and explore the architecture of visual practice in these works.</p>\n\n<p>Week I &amp; II: Present /discuss works of visual based academic information through presentation, film clips. Present /discuss relevant visual narratives, academic comics, mobile episodes, comic strips, web shows and academic narratives in social media.</p>\n\n<p>This will be a presentation and discussion-based approach discussing the presented works in detail and the stories behind making many of these works. The idea will be to discuss the journey of the works from the intent to execution and the struggles and transformations that make the narrative in the final output. For example, Logicomix, a graphic novel that discusses Bertrand Rusell&rsquo;s works and philosophy through a comic, The Beginner series across various subjects, Medical comics and such that are some of the well-articulated works closer to this course.</p>\n\n<p>This will be followed by 3 weeks to ideate, research, explore ideas of student&rsquo;s interest in their areas of discipline followed by field work, data collection and research on the ground. This will include visual data collection, interviews, recording, documentation and conceptualizing the idea based on the research.</p>\n\n<p>Documentation of the research will be followed to process and distill the findings to create the core conceptual idea and be presented in the studio sessions for the benefit of collective brainstorming and discussions. These discussions with fellow classmates will led to an inter-disciplinary ideation and conceptualization, moving closer to shape and sharpen the core project ideas of the students. The students will also be expected to share the processing of their research findings along with their influences and inspirations.</p>\n\n<p>Moving on from research the course will discuss the working process of creating a visual content using multiple influences of form and genres. Depending on the student&rsquo;s interest and academic major, this 1-week study will include detailed discussions on the various possibilities of the form i.e. different forms that can be explored - doodle narratives, zines, comics, mobile based narratives, photo comics, design, layouts, page architecture, typography, sequential storytelling and the work process involved in each, enabling the students to make informed choices in sync with their ideas.</p>\n\n<p>The following week the students will be expected to present their ideas and preliminary drafts as scribbles/ sketches with fellow batchmates, followed by open discussions, suggestions and ideation to evolve a clear understanding to flesh out the final narrative.</p>\n\n<p>Each student/ project will be further exposed to similar works through display and in-depth discussions on influences and ideas related to the project to lend a visual articulation, enabling the student to take one&rsquo;s academic learnings further.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the semester will move to its last 6 weeks to create 1 visual based academic content.</p>\n\n<p>A mid-sem draft presentation will be shared in the studio to display the work in progress after 2 weeks then followed by the final 4 weeks or the end of the semester, ready for display, presentation and production. Studio presence in these weeks will be a must.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Segmented timeline:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Weeks 1-2: Discuss works of visual based academic information through presentation, film clips, relevant visual narratives, academic comics, mobile episodes, comic strips, web shows and academic narratives in social media.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 3-5: Ideate, research, explore academic themes and its relevant visual mediums.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 7: Conceptualize through possibilities of form, information, medium, architecture etc.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 8: Presentation of idea followed by discussion on similar ideas &amp; influences.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 9-14: Final completion with a mid-semester presentation in week 11.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Total Weeks: 14</strong></p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The semester will be a segmented flow from exploring multiple visual forms and practice like academic graphic novels, mobile episodes, zines, comic strips extending to a practice- based approach in sync with one&rsquo;s academic major.</p>\n\n<p>Through the semester students will learn to negotiate between the visuals and the academic world and dive deep in the process of creating their individual content.

We will try to uncover how individual artistic practices are shaped by popular imagery, art history, and visual culture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In thinking of every day through the prism of theatrical reality, the course encourages inquiry about how can drawings and the act of drawing itself is a dialogue about&nbsp;provisionality, uncertainty, and change. How do artists and artistic explorations address issues of meaning-making and shared history, politics, and culture?</p>\n\n<p>How does the process of repetition, layering, overlapping, erasure, and incision transform an image, leading to alternative perspectives about how we perceive and engage with the known? How can we tell the same story in different media, material, and socio-cultural contexts?</p>\n\n<p>Recognizing the importance of contradictions, ambiguity, and serendipity as integral to processes of meaning-making, students have the flexibility to make interventions that can vary from being poetic, polemic, dramatic, metaphorical, provocative, or incisive. You are encouraged to borrow from processes of handmade cinema posters, comics book, experimental theatre, set design, printmaking, photo performance, etc.</p>\n\n<p>By taking figures and forms out of their familiar settings and putting them in a &lsquo;fluid&rsquo; and fantastical environment where seemingly unrelated ideas respond to one another, the course encourages students to attempt blurring of boundaries between fiction and reality.</p>\n\n<p>Modules</p>\n\n<p>Module 1: Narrating and re-narrating</p>\n\n<p>Duration-3 weeks</p>\n\n<p>Class exercises will include the study of selected Kalighat paintings, Amar Chitra Katha, hand-painted posters of early Indian cinema, and the viewing of works from the early 20th-century experimental theatre.

While photographic images&nbsp;stand&nbsp;for&nbsp;real/truth of an image, ie,&nbsp;&#39;this exists&#39; in a moment in time, it is also a framing device; it is an apparatus that lends itself to&nbsp;re-presentation and reproduction of an image.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While a still image captures the fleeting momentary aspect of a world we live in, it represents this moment in specific ways. It reproduces this moment, frames it and imbues it with the subjectivity of the photographer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is this aspect of photography that this assignment explores, especially in relation to early photographic folios, albums and other incunabula as Walter Benjamin points out to us.</p>\n\n<p>Note:&nbsp; Sequentiality and Repetition could be utilised to hold certain directorial vision or poetic aspects to the narrative. Also you could utilise&nbsp;the inherent qualities of a photograph- that a photograph&nbsp;manages to capture&nbsp;a fleeting moment of a second (shutter speeds), as well as varying qualities of light (aperture);&nbsp;&nbsp;it captures certain frames that human eye cannot capture, including a point of view where human eye may not be able to reach.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Module 3: Photography and Identities:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This module will address the complex lines of the real and the fictional in relation to photographic images. The two readings will address the forms and formations of identity and the political nature of representation, distribution and circulation of photographic images.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The module will emphasise on aspects of photography that spill into the amateur, the cinematic, and the everyday. Its ubiquitous aspects will be explored through various lenses.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The practice exercise will be a way for students to address the complex space of creating meanings and identities through photographs.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tableaux Vivant and Photography. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Photography and Anthropology,</p>\n\n<p>Archival Practices and Photography.</p>\n\n<p>Artists References:</p>\n\n<p>Hippolyte Bayard,&nbsp; Marcel Duchamp, Homai Vyarawalla, Helmut Newton, N.

Even the most&nbsp; seasoned media professionals are struggling to determine what the media landscape of the future will look like and what business models can be<br />\nused to support it.&nbsp; It is in times like these when&nbsp;theories of mass communication are particularly valuable.&nbsp; The broadly explanatory concepts of theory help us understand some of the underlying ways in which humans respond to and share different types of information, and can help us&nbsp;make some informed predictions about what the future may hold. This course will introduce students to mass communication theory, and will focuses on theories of audience and effect. This class will provide you with an overview of some of the important theories in the&nbsp;field, and<br />\nwill encourage you to think about how these apply to the real world and how they will inform your future work, perhaps, as a media professional.</p>\n\n<p>This course is cross-listed with Psychology as the two disciplines&nbsp;are closely related. Some studies that are considered seminal in the field of communication were originally conducted by psychologists, e.g. works by Hovland, Bandura, Lasswell, Lewin, Festinger and Fishbein. The two disciplines continue to enrich and enhance each other such that there are many common publication platforms, partnerships among scholars, and common faculty across departments. In terms of the historical evolution of the two fields psychology is an older and more established discipline than communication, hence communication continues to draw on the more consolidated approaches of psychology.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Learning Outcomes</p>\n\n<p>Understand the historical development of Mass Communication theories and how they link with historically important social, political and&nbsp;technological developments in the field of communication</p>\n\n<p>Develop an understanding of the most often used theories of mass communication and the ability to apply them in research and practice</p>\n\n<p>Critically evaluate theories as applied to practical mass communication problems e.g. media portrayals of sex and violence</p>\n\n<p>Understand how mass communication is a powerful tool of persuasion and how it has been and continues to be used across sectors - adverstising, politics, development etc.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Reading materials will be shared with students at the beginning of the semester either as a compendium for the entire semester or in batches arranged according to major theoretical traditions in communication theory.</p>\n\n<p>Some easy reads&nbsp;that students might find useful:</p>\n\n<p>A First Look at Communication Theory by EM Griffin</p>\n\n<p>Mass Communication Theory by Dennis McQuail</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Class participation:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15%<br />\nBrief written critique of selected readings/quiz/other weekly assignments:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20%<br />\nPresentations:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20%<br />\nMid-term paper:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20%<br />\nFinal paper:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25%</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Students should not miss more than 2 class sessions as we will cover a lot of material in each session.

Media outlets refuse to treat marginalised genders as equal participants in the nation and its politics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Many news organisations believe that they are pulling their weight because they publish a few pieces that cater to gender &ndash; the odd inspirational business story, something about reproductive health, the occasional report of domestic or sexual assault, harassment, violence, government schemes or aid for the trans community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So, how can we begin to fix this problem? The answer is that we can apply something known as a gender lens. A gender lens is not a tangible object; it is a way of looking at things, a means to critically assess a wide range of social and political situations, to see how gender-inclusive or gender-sensitive they are.</p>\n\n<p>It highlights the difference in interests for various genders&ndash; within the same household, state, country, or globally &ndash; and also shows how they interact.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Simply put, it is like a pair of spectacles that correct the prevailing view of marginalised genders and their place in the world.</p>\n\n<p>In this course, you will learn how across the global media, gender stereotypes are used to trivialise, objectify and sexualise. With the application of the gender lens, you will be provided with a viewfinder that filters all of that out and exposes the roots of inequality. It will help the students place the spotlight on the realities, needs and perceptions of all genders.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>With a few exceptions &#39;gender issues&#39; are always seen as exclusive of the wider world of economics, politics, sport and current affairs.&nbsp;This class will study reportage on women, men, and LGBTQI issues from an intersectional perspective, as tempered by race, ethnicity, nationality, caste and class &ndash; as well as other factors such as religion, culture and ideology.&nbsp;Through, news&nbsp;reports, films, exercises, field trips, seminars, and discussions, the students will learn how to cover essential stories &ndash; be they of war, poverty, or crime &ndash; objectively and responsibly, by looking for the intersections of gender and these &ldquo;bigger&rdquo; issues.&nbsp;The students will be taught how to use these intersections to write ground reports, narrative pieces and profiles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Two field trips are included in this course</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Prerequisite:&nbsp; Student should have done either the Media Studies Course - Introduction to Newswriting and Reporting</p>\n\n<p>OR&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Any other Gender based course (offered by any department at Ashoka, in any of the semesters before this Spring semester.

Are our social interactions forms of playacting? How about the ways in which we present ourselves&mdash;as gendered bodies, as students, as friends, as professors, and as so many other less nameable identities&mdash;are these too performances? What would it tell us if we were to think of everyday social interaction and self-presentation as performance? Does this mean our interactions are shallow, our relationships fake, and our personalities mere pretense? Or will it reveal aspects of everyday life that otherwise remain hidden in plain view? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>These are some questions that inspire this course to explore the social phenomenon of performance and its theoretical value to the humanities. We will investigate the ways in which our everyday behaviours and the stories we tell shape our identities and our experience of the world. We will see how thinking <em>of</em>, <em>with</em>, and <em>through </em>performance can help us investigate social behaviour, individual and collective identity, and embodied knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We will do so by focusing on three recurring themes: first, the relationship between representation and performance, which will help us understand social behaviour; second, the paradigm of performativity, which is significant to theorizing identity; and third, the debate between whether performance is an ephemeral or enduring phenomenon, which is central to conceptualizing embodied knowledges. We will see, in short, how performance&mdash;as object, method, and analytic&mdash;can help us understand societies and cultures by focusing on acts of doing, ways of being, and modes of knowing. We will read Judith Butler, JL Austin, Diana Taylor, Richard Schechner, Susan Sontag, Harry Elam, Victor Turner, Bishnupriya Dutt, Erving Goffman, Clifford Geertz, Aparna Dharwadker, Ngugi wa Thiong&rsquo;o, and Paulla Ebron. We will also engage with Dharamvir Bharati&rsquo;s <em>Andha Yug</em>, Maya Rao&rsquo;s <em>Walk</em>, and the real-life cases of Rachel Dolezal and Jessica Krug.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>(Undergrads may sign up for&nbsp;ENG-2610 or PA-2610, while grads are welcome to sign up for ENG-4610.)&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

What are the forces that shape the lives and practices of individuals referred to in public discourse as craftsmen, or &lsquo;folk &lsquo;and &lsquo;tribal&rsquo; artists in post -colonial India? How much agency do they have over their lives and practice and to what extent are they &lsquo;manipulated&rsquo; by &lsquo;outside&rsquo; mediations? And how do tradition and modernity parley with each other in the shaping of their work and careers? This course is designed to make students actively debate and engage with these issues and beyond, through case studies of practitioners of both material and performative practices from Central India. It&nbsp;&nbsp;examines trajectories in artisanal and performative practices from the region of Madhya Pradesh and the recently created state of Chhattisgarh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The course will acquaint students with case histories of practitioners, from the ground,&nbsp;&nbsp;to trace trajectories of transformation. Students will engage with questions of caste and community, agency, selfhood, and gender, to understand the shaping of art forms and their contexts. They will be led to look at&nbsp;&nbsp;shifting contexts for the production&nbsp;&nbsp;and reception of art practices, examining&nbsp;&nbsp;the role of the state, museums and institutions, exhibitions and the market in creating binary categories of &lsquo;art&rsquo; verses &lsquo;craft&rsquo;. A key component will be unravelling histories and modes of intervention following developmental or anthropological paradigms in the field.</p>\n\n<p>Discussions will be largely based on films and video recordings from the &lsquo;field&rsquo;, interviews, exhibition catalogues and on- site visits to the crafts museum&nbsp;&nbsp;and art galleries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Course Structure and modules</strong></p>\n\n<p>The course syllabus&nbsp;focuses on the following set of practices and forms from Central&nbsp;India. It follows developments in the lives of practitioners and their practice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Modules</strong></p>\n\n<p>&lsquo;Gond&rsquo; art</p>\n\n<p>In 2001, the artist Jangarh Singh Shyam committed suicide at a Museum in Japan, unable to return home before&nbsp;&nbsp;paintings that had been&nbsp;&nbsp;commissioned by the Museum&nbsp;&nbsp;were completed. He was a Gond Pradhan,&nbsp;&nbsp;from an &lsquo;adivasi&#39;&nbsp;community in Central India, famously &lsquo;discovered&rsquo; by the art world in 1981. This module charts his life and art through films, art works and publications and examines the role of played by art world interlocutors in shaping his life and career.&nbsp;Lectures will look at&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Gond art &lsquo; as&nbsp;&nbsp;a tradition that was &lsquo;invented&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;in recent times, and look at individuals who followed Jangarh Singh Shaym to trace trajectories in their practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will also look at&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;primitivism&rsquo; as a phenomenon in 20th&nbsp;century modern art&nbsp;&nbsp;to unpack ideologies that informed the discovery of &lsquo;adivasi&rsquo; artists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Rajwar clay sculpture&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Valorised as a woman sculptor whose art was born of loneliness, Sona Bai&rsquo;s life changed completely after her discovery by teams from Bharat Bhavan, an&nbsp;art intitution based in&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhopal. Her art which was made from local clay found in&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarguja in Chhattisgarh&nbsp;&nbsp;shaped into sculptures and screens, began to&nbsp;&nbsp;adorn museums and exhibition spaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did this shift from a domestic space&nbsp;&nbsp;in the interiors of Chhattisgarh to sites of international exhibition do to her art and how much agency did she have in shaping her life or work? Which markets defined her work&nbsp;&nbsp;as individualistic&nbsp;&nbsp;art practice and which defined it as&nbsp;&nbsp;craft born of women&rsquo;s labour?&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens when her work, which was domestic and therefore private,&nbsp;&nbsp;enters a larger public sphere for staging ethnicities? Students will look at films, exhibition catalogues and in situ installations to understand her art and that of others who followed her.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Gadhwa metal sculpture, Bastar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The module will&nbsp;&nbsp;focus on the transformation of&nbsp;&nbsp;metal sculptures from Bastar, from objects of ritual use to highly sought after objects in the art market.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jaidev Baghel, metal sculptor from Bastar, was able to negotiate a space for himself across markets, moving between art worlds and sites for the marketing of&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;crafts. Students will look at his work and that of the modernist sculptor Meera Mukherjee&nbsp;&nbsp;who apprenticed under him to see how both practices changed through the interaction. They will also examine how the idea of the &lsquo;folk&rsquo; feeds into ideas of authenticity and nationality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Between ethnography and anthropology&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>How have ethnography and anthropology as disciplines shaped the work of largely urban based individuals and institutions to inform interventions in the field?&nbsp;&nbsp;Students will look at the work of the anthropologist&nbsp;Verrier Elwin, artist and adminsitrator&nbsp;&nbsp;J . Swaminathan, photographer Sunil Janah, culture activist Pupul Jaykar, artists Meera Mukherjee, Navjot Altaf&nbsp;to raise questions about ethics and intentionality. &lsquo;</p>\n\n<p>Performative practices</p>\n\n<p>This module looks at&nbsp;&nbsp;shifts in the performances of the&nbsp;Pandvani, (stories of the Pandavas recited in Chhattisgarh), and the&nbsp;Lorik Chanda&nbsp;, tracing the emergence of&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;professional artists&rsquo; and the shifts from oral to textual sources of storytelling.

We will investigate classic formulations of these questions and the ways that philosophers from various time periods and philosophical traditions have tried to answer them. At the same time, we will also look into the ways that these questions apply to our daily lives.

Generally&nbsp;speaking, logic is the study of correct reasoning. Informal logic studies correct&nbsp;patterns of inference, in a relatively informal way. Formal logic, on the<br />\nother hand, studies correct patterns of inference, in a relatively formal way.&nbsp; By &ldquo;formal&rdquo;, we just mean the way a mathematician might do it. Symbolic&nbsp;logic is formal logic, where correct patterns of inference are symbolized into&nbsp;an artificial language. This class will cover both informal and formal logic,&nbsp;and so will contain a mixture of symbolic and non-symbolic representations&nbsp;of arguments. The aim is to introduce students to basic logical concepts,&nbsp;different logical systems, various paradoxes and other conundrums central&nbsp;to the development of formal logic, and perhaps most importantly, to learn&nbsp;how to reason better, primarily through learning how to diagram and evaluate&nbsp;arguments, not only those found &ldquo;in the wild&rdquo;, but also one&rsquo;s own&nbsp;arguments. Topics will include: logical notations, diagramming&nbsp;arguments, quantification, formal proofs, paradox, classical logic,&nbsp;modal logic, various non-classical logics, inductive logic, computer logic,&nbsp;metalogic, and some (light) set theory.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

Formal logic studies cases like this and provides us with a notion of <em>deductive validity</em> that can explain why the first inference is better than the second. In this course, we will develop this notion, along with a few others, by studying two formal languages called &quot;propositional logic&quot; and &quot;first-order logic&quot;. These languages will allow us to precisely define validity and to check whether a given argument is valid in these languages.

We will get to know the major Brahmanical, Buddhist, and Jain philosophical schools, and read from the texts of such philosophers as Vasubandhu, Pata&ntilde;jali, Vātsyāyana, Īśvarakṛṣṇa, and Śaṁkara.

Very few scientists would confess the term or concept has any scientific validity whatsoever. It is also a fairly recent concept per se to appear in discourse. Nevertheless, the term is also essential in referring to the pertinent concepts that racists laud. There is an apparent inconsistency, then, between those who refer approvingly to the content and those who would rather the concept fizzle away&mdash;but then must refer&nbsp;to that concept somehow.This course begins with some historical tracing of the term and&mdash;apparently arising later&mdash;the concept, which may have come much earlier than the term. Pre-20th&nbsp;Century Philosophers&rsquo; investigation into race include Hume, Kant, and Mill,&nbsp;include&nbsp;Darwin and those he influenced, and in the 20th&nbsp;Century, this philosophical question has grabbed the interests of a range of thinkers, including anthropologists, political theorists, and biologists. While this growth has soared, real and dangerous cases persist to this day, as in race-based slavery in Sudan, caste systems, and not to speak of &ldquo;white&rdquo; Americans whose racial hatred continues to boiling up in atrocities. This course is at once theoretical and inspiring concern for how action may be taken against this ongoing scourge.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One curious result of this ongoing inquiry and activism is that persons affected by racism may also find that their personal identity takes an unexpected turn when they find themselves&nbsp;identifying&nbsp;themselves with fellow groups that were established by racist divisions. That is, both white persons and black may find ng themselves with groups labelled black by &ldquo;white&rdquo; groups clustering blacks into a natural kind. Personal identification with those who negatively defined them becomes a not-easily-resolved problem.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Depending on student preference, we may also turn to the twin sister of social discrimination and personal identity, gender identity. This area of research grew out of feminism, with surges intensifying in the 1970s and 80s. Feminism has been one great spur to this area, in opening thinkers to defying the gender status quo and even embracing it as an identity in which they grew up, as seen in the Queer movement in which activists admitted to being what had long been considered an epithet.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Grades are based on student attendance and active class participation, final exam, and a term paper (roughly 30% of total in counted under each of these four criteria).</p>\n</div></div>"

This suggests that, even though believing X might make you feel nice or make you money, these are bad reasons to believe X because they are not evidence that X is true. However, in recent years, many philosophers have begun to suspect that value factors <em>are</em>&nbsp;relevant to what we should believe. For example, perhaps we should believe our friends more easily and strongly than we believe strangers because of the <em>moral&nbsp;duties of friendship</em>, or perhaps we should not form certain beliefs about people <em>even when we have strong evidence for these beliefs</em>, because <em>forming these beliefs would be prejudiced or rude</em>. Maybe our beliefs can cause injustice against others and cause them harm. Maybe believing in conspiracy theories, fake news, and other sources of misinformation&nbsp;is bad because of its moral consequences. This course explores these and other debates at the intersection of ethics and epistemology. Our goal is to see whether ethics and epistemology&nbsp;really are separate. If they are separate, then they are each guided by their own principles, even if these principles conflict with each other. If they are not separate, then they are guided by the same principles, some of which might surprise us.</p>\n</div></div>"

The introductory concepts (that we will study in this course) are easy to understand, but are powerful and apply in many contexts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The applications to various fields are too numerous to mention. Lets&nbsp; just say that the modern world would not be so modern without the application of linear algebra, &nbsp;nor would&nbsp;our understanding of the universe would be where it is now.&nbsp;And neither would mathematics be as developed if all kinds of mathematical objects are not studied using linear algebra. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>However, the course is mostly mathematical. Applications will be to understand some mathematical objects.The subject unfolds slowly over the semester.&nbsp;As you work through the semester, you learn how to extend your intuition of&nbsp;two and&nbsp;three dimensions to work in an n-dimensional space. At the same time, as the title of the main textbook reflects,&nbsp; this course may be regarded as an&nbsp;introduction to abstract mathematics. So you learn how to apply logical arguments to prove statements.</p>\n\n<p>Its a busy course requiring a lot of effort and enthusiasm. You have to be young and energetic and want&nbsp;to learn a lot very quickly. But why&nbsp;am I saying this?&nbsp;You are Ashoka students.&nbsp;Of course you are young and energetic and want to learn a lot very quickly!</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The syllabus in the course handbook is as follows.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong>&nbsp;Real&nbsp;vector spaces, subspaces, spanning sets, basis sets, dimension of a vector space.&nbsp; Solution of a system of linear equations.&nbsp;Row space and column space of a matrix, rank of a matrix, elementary row and column operations of a matrix.&nbsp;Inversion of square matrices, rank factorization of a matrix.&nbsp;Properties of determinants.&nbsp;Linear transformations, range and null space of a linear transformation, rank-nullity theorem.&nbsp;Matrix representation of a linear transformation.&nbsp;Inner product spaces, normed linear spaces, examples of different normed linear spaces, orthonormal basis sets.&nbsp;Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, characteristic polynomials.&nbsp;Spectral theorem for real symmetric matrices.&nbsp;Singular value decompositions.</p>\n\n<p>We are likely to do all the above for vector spaces over Complex numbers. The proof of the Spectral theorem is&nbsp;a little easier for this.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Text book:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Isaiah Lankham, Bruno Nachtergaele and Anne Schilling,&nbsp;Linear Algebra - As an Introduction to Abstract Mathematics, Free online text available from:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~anne/linear_algebra/</p>\n\n<p>We will cover most of the book including Appendix A.</p>\n\n<p>The course material is roughly from this book, but I may deviate considerably.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional References.</strong></p>\n\n<p>You may find the following books helpful as supplementary reading in case something is not clear from the textbook.</p>\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;S. H. Friedberg, A. J. Insel and L. E. Spence,&nbsp;Linear algebra, Pearson, 2015. (Good book for extensive explanations, lots of problems for you to make sure you have understood the topics.)</p>\n\n<p>2. P. Bogacki, Linear Algebra, Concepts and Applications, AMS/MAA Textbooks, Vol 47, 2019. (Good for matrix examples.)</p>\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;Gilbert Strang,&nbsp;Linear Algebra and its Applications, (4th or 5th edition). (The classic textbook. Covers a lot. At some point in your career, you should become familiar with it. Lectures are also available for these.)</p>\n\n<p>4. T. Shifrin and M. R. Adams, Linear Algebra: A Geometric Approach, WH Freeman (2nd edition). (Nice book with a geometric flavor. Great for gaining intuition.)</p>\n\n<p>5. Wikipedia is great for mathematics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>6. I will hand out a problem set which includes (most of) Professor Bhatia&#39;s problems from a few years ago.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Computer algebra system.</strong></p>\n\n<p>We will make extensive use of the computer algebra system SAGE. In the real world, Linear Algebra is done using many different numerical packages. However, we use a symbolic algebra package. SAGE&nbsp;is available at:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sagemath.org\">www.sagemath.org</a></p>\n\n<p>Please install it before coming to class. Write to me in case of difficulties. There is a possibility of using it online too, but that has become very slow and irritating. It has to be used as a last resort.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>There will be 10 quizzes (in lecture) (on occasion replaced by&nbsp;Assignments) (33.33% of grade),&nbsp; 2 midterms (in lecture) (33.33%) and a take home final (33.33%).&nbsp; Midterms 1 and 2 are&nbsp; in-class exams.&nbsp;More details will be provided on the first day of class. A max of 2 missed quiz scores can be replaced by average of rest. &nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>While there is no formal requirement to attend lectures and DS sessions, it may be a good idea to do so because we may deviate or add to the material in the textbook which may show up on quizzes and tests. In general, its easier to read the book when you&nbsp;know&nbsp;whats going on in the lectures. Further, there will be no makeup exams (Quizzes or midterms) and these will happen during class times. Usually for math courses expect to spend a minimum of 4-5 hours outside of class every week to keep up.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

It asks a broad range of questions that are both theoretically and substantially important. What are states and how did they become the primary form of political organization in the world? Why are some states more capable than others? Why are some countries more prosperous than others, is there one or many paths toward economic development? Why is inequality rising across the world? What is ethnicity and nationalism and why is it associated with conflict and violence? What is globalization, and why is it celebrated in the Global South and associated with rising populism in the West? We will integrate theory with case studies from across the world with keen attention to Indian politics.</p>\n\n<p>As a foundation course, it will also place an equal emphasis on familiarising students with the political science &lsquo;approach&rsquo; to studying politics and society. A thorough understanding of the scientific enquiry will prepare you to expertly read empirical (that is, research that is based on observation) journal articles and books. We will understand the logic of comparing cases to draw inferences in a scientific manner. We will become comfortable with thinking about politics in terms of unit of analysis, independent and dependent variables, and alternative explanations. The course will also explain how political science attempts to reach causality, that is, how evidence is used to make convincing claims that a particular factor &ldquo;causes&rdquo; a phenomenon (state capacity, economic development, civil wars) more significantly than others.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The goals of the course are three-fold. By the end of the course, students should have an overview of some of the major debates in the field of comparative politics. This will prepare students to take advanced courses in political science and other social science departments. Second, the course will reinforce the department&rsquo;s continuous training in analytical thinking. It will bolster students&rsquo; ability to distinguish between different theoretical explanations, evaluate the merit of competing arguments made in the literature, and communicate their arguments clearly in written form. Finally, the course will also augment students&rsquo; intellectual ability to take an informed stand in contemporary political debates and become more consummate readers of news and popular media.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Included with the syllabus, to be shared soon.&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The course will not use scaled grading.

Nearly every aspect about&nbsp;them is disputed &ndash; from their role in &ldquo;feeding the world&rdquo; and their impacts with respect to yield and environment to regulatory policies and peoples&rsquo; notions of choice and ethics. This course examines the GM debate by looking at the transformations of agriculture and agricultural sciences in the 20th century. It analyzes how private industry has sought profits from agriculture, and the consequent impacts on farming communities. This will help us grasp deeper issues that are often lost in heated anti/pro-GM arguments. Surveying controversies in India, the USA and other parts of the world, the course will demonstrate how the GM debate is shaped by the inter-related shifts in law, politics, and science. By way of examining the case of Bt cotton, Golden Rice, Bt brinjal&nbsp;among others, the course ultimately invites the question: Where do GM crops fit in the landscape of the burning issues faced by the average farmer, if at all?</p>\n\n<p>More broadly, the questions we will consider in this class are, in fact, relevant to most technologies incident upon agriculture, and on the relationship between technology and society, in general.

It is comprehensive introduction to a way of analyzing and researching global politics and international relations that takes gender seriously as a category of analysis.&nbsp; More specifically, it is concerned with how ideas of war, peace, sovereignty, violence, foreign policy, governance and political economy are sustained by specific masculinities and femininities, and how these particular gender constructions impact on the lives of particular groups of men and women. Set against this, the aim of the course is mainly threefold: firstly, to (re)introduce how the discipline has traditionally thought about war and peace; secondly, to reveal the gendered constructions and inequalities that mark the traditional scholarship; and thirdly, to evaluate the specific contribution that feminist critiques have made as part of the so-called &lsquo;Critical Turn&rsquo; in IR. Gender is understood here not as a synonym for &lsquo;woman&rsquo; but as a hierarchical coding of masculinity and femininity that pervades social relations and institutional practices, with systemic (though not deterministic) effects on inequalities. Gender meanings and practices permeate our lives, and a closer look at these processes is more illuminating than many anticipate, with relevance and implications for who we are, how we think, and how we act &ndash; as individuals, groups, communities and nation-states.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><ul>\n\t<li>Understand the landscape of feminist international relations thought and challenge gender-blind and gendered approaches to global politics</li>\n\t<li>Complicate understandings of global politics by identifying relationship between global crises and global gender(ed) divisions</li>\n\t<li>Appreciate that the international is personal and the personal is international and&nbsp; recognize the necessity and complexity of taking gender seriously in global politics.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Pre-requisite- a 100 level introductory IR course.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>It is a continuous process- Class presentations, mid-term assessment, group project and end term assessment.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>There are three excused absences allowed for the semester.</p>\n</div></div>"

The concept of social exclusion as an analytical framework has become increasingly relevant for an understanding of the notions of environmental inequality, conflicts, rights and justice. The course will capture the social exclusion structures and processes which restrict the access of certain social groups to environmental resources and entitlements. It will explain the different forms of social disadvantage &ndash; in village and community, in land and water, in space and commons, in wilderness and conservation &ndash; that persist, in multiple variants and with different intensity, across societies and nations. It will locate the agency to groups that either guard their domain of privilege or challenge the system of social inequalities and segmentation. Thus, understanding social exclusion as a condition/outcome as well as a dynamic process, the course will also examine some environmental justice movements. The course will also be contextually and temporally embedded. In the north, for example, along with African-Americans, Latino and indigenous people, the focus has been the changing nature of social exclusion in environment. Accordingly, the relevant focus groups are the new social groups, including the immigrants and ethnic groups. By contrast, in the Indian context, the problem is one of the persistent, multiple exclusion of certain social groups like Dalit affecting their basic environmental access and rights.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The course is organized around weekly lectures and discussions based on the readings. Students will be asked to write an essay on one of the topics of the course, with footnotes and bibliography, and further readings will be given to them on their chosen topic, so that they can go in much more depth on a particular topic.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Unit 1: (Week 1): Social Exclusion and Environmental Justice: An Introduction to Conceptual Issues</p>\n\n<p>Unit 2: (Week 2-3): Race, Caste, Class and Environment: Patterns and Processes</p>\n\n<p>Class written assignment</p>\n\n<p>Unit 3: (Week 4-6): Revisiting Village, Community, Water, Commons: Sites of Social Exclusion</p>\n\n<p>Class written assignment</p>\n\n<p>Unit 4: (Week 7-9): Social Exclusion and Environmental Change: Insights in the literature of Jotirao Phule, E.

It is motivated by a set of perplexing observations about armed conflict in India. First, India&rsquo;s response to civil wars (or insurgencies) involves both massive levels of violence to coerce communities into obedience, and extensive distribution of development funds to induce loyalty. Do these strategies complement or contradict each other? What is the long-term effect of these strategies?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Second, India has an impressive track record in defeating armed groups, but it struggles to resolve conflicts. Regions like Kashmir, Nagaland, and Manipur continue to remain affected by low levels of violence. Why?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Third, India&rsquo;s governing institutions do not fritter away. Generally, we do not notice a complete breakdown of law and order that often leads to large-scale migration in other countries. Instead, civil administration remains robust and even expands during civil wars. How does India succeed in avoiding the World Bank&rsquo;s conflict-trap hypothesis, wherein armed conflict depletes state&rsquo;s capacity and creates conditions for future conflict?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, even as India limits fundamental rights (such as right to assembly, right to speech and opinion) through the Armed Forces Special Powers Act time and again, it is eager to resume electoral democracy. Why? Why not just continue with the President&rsquo;s Rule?&nbsp;From Kashmir to Nagaland, elections in conflict zones register exceptionally high participation. Yet, contrary to the convention that voting is an indicator of legitimacy, surveys and ethnographies show that communities affected by conflict do not positively associate with Indian identity, or at the very least, their identification with Indian nationalism is tenuous. How do democratic institutions operate in conflict zones where political rights are limited by the threat of violence by both sides?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To understand these seemingly contradictory observations, one must look beyond the literature on civil war. The course, therefore, is a compliment to Militants or Freedom Fighters? Armed Conflicts in India (familiarity with the civil war literature is not essential to understand content in <em>Nations..</em>) that examines civil wars in India through the lens of major works&nbsp;of civil wars.&nbsp;Nation and State-Making in India&rsquo;s Borders will use canonical works of nationalism, state formation, organised violence, and the politics of development as pillars to guide our search for answers to these vexing questions. Equipped with the knowledge of theory, we will study detailed case studies and collectively discuss the most convincing explanations for patterns of nation and state-making in India&rsquo;s contested borderlands.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The goals of the course are three-fold. By the end of the course, students should have an overview of some of the major debates in the political science of nation and state-making (or state-formation). We will collectively grapple with understanding linkages between state and nation-making with civil wars. In doing so, the course will also familiarise students with major civil wars (or &lsquo;insurgencies&rsquo;) in India through detailed case studies. Finally, the course will reinforce the department&rsquo;s continuous training in analytical thinking. It will bolster students&rsquo; ability to distinguish between different theoretical explanations, evaluate the merit of competing arguments made in the literature, and communicate their arguments clearly in written form.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Included with the syllabus, to be shared soon.&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The course will not use scaled grading.

Since this concern links two concept groups, this course doubles as a stylized and brief introduction to the literature on foreign aid and democratization. In democratization (Part I), we will consider the type of foreign interventions, the drivers of democratization, the special role of elections and the varieties of authoritarianism. In Foreign aid (Part II), we will cover the types of foreign aid, the efficacy debate, the modalities of democracy aid, the incentive of aid donors and recipients and donor switching.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>After the theoretical overview, we consider a practical approach to existing political constraints (Part III), as articulated in my book, Liberalization at the Margins. We skim the empirics and put more emphasis on the case studies of the aid-democratization dynamic for Egypt, Fiji, and Myanmar. We conclude by considering the policy implications of such strategies with an emphasis on the authoritarian backlash (and authoritarian strategies for international law.)</p>\n\n<p>The attached syllabus is obviously a draft.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Through the course, students should be able to 1) identify the major issues and debates in foreign aid, 2) analyse the costs and benefits of various modalities of democracy aid, and 3) consider the policy implications of democracy promotion.

As a bonus, students get a sense of the background work that goes into the writing of a book, They may appreciate (or not!) that what you see the finished product &ndash; the book - is merely the tip iceberg.

Political debate often centers around ideals like nationalism, secularism, liberty, justice, constitutionalism, democracy and the like. Some skeptics believe that when politicians appeal to ideals, they always do so self-servingly in the pursuit of power. But even power is a political concept. Understanding political concepts are therefore important for participants in politics &ndash; and all of us are participants in politics as citizens. But understanding political concepts is also important to analyze and explain political events. After all, explanations often involve political concepts like democracy, federalism, the rule of law, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Political theory is the sub-field of political science that critically engages with political concepts and ideas. There are two main approaches to political theory: history of political thought &ndash; studying the development and history of ideas &ndash; and political philosophy &ndash; studying political ideas systematically. Students can meet their political theory requirement through a course in either of the traditions. Introduction to Political Theory focuses on political philosophy, although we will read some historic texts both from Europe and India.</p>\n\n<p>The course is divided into four big parts. We begin by studying <strong>democracy and constitutionalism</strong>. Is there a will of the people? Is democracy possible? Is constitutionalism a compromise with democracy? Ideas of constitutionalism are often associated with <strong>liberalism and secularism</strong>. The second part discusses these ideas. What is the basis for human rights? How should we understand secularism? Do liberty and equality conflict? The last question points towards another domain of politics: social justice. In the third part we look more closely at <strong>social justice</strong>. We look at questions of caste, class, and gender. Some of these questions are often framed as identity politics. One form of identity is that of shared citizenship. Another threat that binds us together is our shared humanity. How should we think of these two connections, <strong>nationalism and cosmopolitanism</strong>? How should we do political theory in light of this?</p>\n</div></div>"

The gap between the global North and global South is particularly stark as evidenced by just a few distressing indicators: 1.4 billion people live on less than $1.25 a day; 1.1 billion people have inadequate access to water; 2.6 billion lack basic sanitation; 24,000 children die each day due to poverty.</p>\n\n<p>This seminar examines some of the major theories, paradigms, perspectives, concepts and policies that, over the past 60 years, have attempted to explain, predict or otherwise effect change in the global South, including modernization and dependency theory, neoliberalism, human development, post-development, and feminist contributions to development. The course also surveys some contemporary perspectives on the discourse and practice of development, such as participatory development, the &ldquo;good governance&rdquo; agenda, and the &ldquo;institutional turn.&rdquo; This is a multidisciplinary social science course, drawing on &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; and &ldquo;critical&rdquo; literature from development studies, geography, anthropology, and sociology. We should note at the outset that development is not static, and that it has long been impelled by both practical and theoretical concerns. It has also been and continues to be shaped by geopolitical interests and social scientific trends that are not immediately tied to development. Bearing this in mind, we shall seek to answer the following key questions this semester: What is development? How have our ideas about development, its causes, and its objectives changed over time? Why, after 60 years of development, are so many people still suffering from poverty, economic decline, ill health, political insecurity, repression, and powerlessness? Where should we focus our development efforts in the future?</p>\n\n<p>Goals</p>\n\n<p>This course is intended to survey the major debates that have occurred within development studies over the past 60 years.

We will examine Mao&rsquo;s theories and practice of revolution through a thematic lens: not as biographical artifacts but as thought produced by and constitutive of the revolutionary circumstances in the twentieth-century world at large and China in particular.&nbsp; Our aim will be to investigate how three modal terms&mdash;Chinese, Revolutionary, Marxist&mdash;reflect on each other as open questions when Mao Zedong is studied in contextually-embedded and philosophically complex manner.</p>\n\n<p>Situating the world in an intimate dialogic relationship to China, we will ask the questions; was Mao a Marxist? How was Mao&rsquo;s Marxism inflected by his positionality of being Chinese in a revolutionary twentieth-century world? How was Mao&rsquo;s Chineseness influenced by his being a revolutionary in the twentieth-century world? How was Marxism impacted by Mao&rsquo;s articulation of revolution in the twentieth-century world? The readings for this class will mostly be drawn from Mao&rsquo;s own writings, and students will be expected to read these texts intensively, with an open mind. While this course does not require any previous knowledge of China, as an advanced level class, a familiarity with general twentieth-century world history and/or a background in the history of Marxism will be helpful. Students with prior background in neither will be expected to learn on a very steep curve.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Read intertextually and understand literary productions as artefacts of historical and social construction.</p>\n\n<p>Summarize academic monographs in East Asian studies and introduce salient points in&nbsp;notes and in speech.</p>\n\n<p>Be able to draw connections between works to gain an overview of scholarly and historiographical debates.</p>\n\n<p>Be able to trace theoretical or methodological trends across multiple empirical contexts.</p>\n\n<p>Learn the skills of co-writing and co-presenting to gain a sense of how cooperative work can integrate intellectual property as well as collective clarity.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>You are not required to purchase any materials for this course.

That is to say, scrutinizing the beliefs and attitudes that typically go unexamined in a text, drawing attention to the gaps, silences, contradictions, and unspoken impetus that animate written words, but also reading that text through the various registers of its production and circulation&mdash;as an artefact of literary, historical and social conditions that may or may not alter its imagined &ldquo;original&rdquo; context. We are reading Mao, but we will never take him for his word.</p>\n\n<p>I will not take attendance in each class meeting, however, participation in weekly class discussions is a mandatory part of your grade and is necessary for succeeding in the course. If you have circumstances that might affect attendance at a specific class meeting, please let me know ahead of time whenever possible. Flexibility is especially important since Covid is still with us. To protect your privacy, please do not describe any medical situations to me; just inform me that the situation exists and be prepared to provide a doctor&rsquo;s note if requested.</p>\n\n<p>Participation is part of your grade, and should be based on attentive reading, listening, and preparation. Always keep an open mind and be respectful of your classmates and your instructor regardless of what you wish to say, or whether you agree with what has already been said. Being respectful also means that (1) if you have not completed a particular reading, please refrain from commenting on it (2) in the normal course of discussion, if you have just spoken, you should refrain from speaking again until others who wish to contribute have done so (3) contributions to discussion should be based on the readings, lectures, and discussion questions, and should aim to improve our collective understanding of them. In general, please avoid unstructured/unsupported reflections as well as topics that are beyond the scope of the course.</p>\n\n<p>Writing Portfolio</p>\n\n<p>Two-thirds of your final grade for this class will depend on two written pieces that will be thematically related and proceed from each other. The purpose of these pieces is to help you further navigate the landscape of political writing, by interrogating how the processes of (narrative) writing engage with the conveying of &ldquo;information&rdquo; in the quest for coherence, conviction, and accessibility.</p>\n\n<p>The first of these pieces will be a Report on an Investigation of the&nbsp; &lt; &gt; Movement, approx. 5000-6000 words, modeled on Mao&rsquo;s famous Report on the Hunan Peasant Movement. For this first piece, you may choose between reporting on the working conditions of a) campus workers at Ashoka or b) teaching fellows at Ashoka.</p>\n\n<p>The second text is an opinion piece (no longer than 1,000 words) that condenses your longer report into a piece that should function as a call to action. Unlike the first piece, where your stated purpose is an &ldquo;investigation&rdquo;, your purpose in this second piece is to craft an appeal.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that you have the option of writing both the Report and the op-ed as a team project, but that the requirements will change accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>For both pieces, you may choose to conduct interviews in person, speak to campus &ldquo;experts&rdquo;, read theoretical texts or works providing historical background. The methodology is entirely up to you, but you are encouraged discuss your thinking and writing process with me through a series of progress meetings. These meetings will count for ten percent of your final grade.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/9132cd31-e21b-4d9d-b123-10a0f568bf49.docx' download='An Interpretive History of Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Revolution.docx'>An Interpretive History of Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Revolution.docx</a></td></tr></table></div></div>"

From academics to public policy practitioners, to non-profit organizations all increasingly rely on data science techniques for cleaning and gathering data, conducting data analysis, and presenting the results. For example, multiple datasets often need to be transformed, aggregated, and merged before a more comprehensive analysis can be carried out.&nbsp; Researchers might need to create datasets from scratch by converting a large number of PDFs into machine-readable texts or scraping data from a website or interacting with an API. These tasks require knowing, among other things &ndash; basic data wrangling concepts, concepts for cleaning messy datasets, and familiarity with programming concepts for creating a data flow that can be replicated and shared with multiple collaborators. This course will provide students with the skills necessary for successfully carrying out quantitative social science research, by deploying data science techniques.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The research questions students will engage with will be related to the political economy of development. For example, we will try to understand the relationship between the level of socio-economic development and political outcomes like incumbency and competition, examine the determinants of differences in quality of public service delivery and local institutions, or explore how the background of individual bureaucrats shapes their career trajectories. These broad sets of relationships will be examined from different perspectives throughout the course. We will begin by basic descriptive statistics, then visualize the data in different ways. To achieve this the course will rely on the R statistical software (open source) using a predefined set of freely available datasets (more details below). Students will learn how to gather, aggregate, analyze, and interpret datasets as well as presenting findings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The course can be divided into two broad parts that have substantial overlap. The first part of the course will focus on the basics of data science &ndash; data wrangling, visualization, and analysis. These skills will teach students how to aggregate, transform, and merge datasets for a richer analysis. The second part will focus on data gathering and cleaning. In this section, the students will be creating new datasets by gathering data from websites and APIs and then cleaning and processing the data. The aim here is to expose students to the challenges of creating new datasets.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>By the end of the course, students should be able to</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Understand basic programming terminologies, structures, and conventions</li>\n\t<li>Write, execute, and debug R code for data analysis, and visualization</li>\n\t<li>Be familiar with regular expressions and basic data cleaning techniques&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Be familiar with the basics of web scraping and APIs</li>\n\t<li>Be able to gather, analyze, visualize large scale datasets&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Be able to use understand and communicate relationship between variables&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Do preliminary geospatial analysis&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Overall goal of the course is to enabled students with the ability to gather new sets of data and pursue new research ideas&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Requirements</p>\n\n<p>Students are not required to have prior programming experience or a background in computer science to take this course.

While it is well established that male bodies make up the vast majority of decision-makers and participants in quotidian electoral politics, the same logic applies to contexts affected by conflict and war. Conventionally, male bodies are considered to be at the forefront of decision-making about whether to go to war, and on the frontlines of said wars as fighters.</p>\n\n<p>In the last few decades, however, these constructions of masculinity and femininity in conflict have come to be questioned. Instead, the understanding that gender affects the way in which we see and make sense of the world around us &ndash;&nbsp;and that men and women experience and affect wartime dynamics differently &ndash; has come front and center. In the same spirit, we will focus on the role of women in political decision-making and participation; their role both as perpetrators of violence as combatants (and terrorists), as victims and as survivors of male-victimizing atrocities; the militarization of gendered bodies and the impact of gender-based violence in armed conflict.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we will reflect on the gendered aspects of women&rsquo;s restructuring of economies in male absence, their resistance to political violence, and their role in peacekeeping and rebuilding societies after war. As we cover each theme, we will pay particular attention to what feminists have described as intersectionality and the continuum of violence, from the &ldquo;private&rdquo; to the &ldquo;public&rdquo; sphere, from the militarization of everyday living to overt violent conflict.</p>\n</div></div>"

It takes issues such as inequality, claims to absolute certainty (associated with religion and science), and problems of political representation, and examines theoretical attempts to resolve some of these problems against the historical and cultural realities to be found in Western and Indian democracy. Students will read texts from Plato to the present-day, and consider examples from 18th century France and America, to 21st century India, in order better to understand the theoretical blindspots and the practical potentials of democratic politics in diverse national contexts today<br />\nDemocracy has established itself as the universal norm of political legitimacy, invoked alike to justify the domestic claims of states as well as their international adventures. Yet even at the height of its apparent historical triumph, it faces serious difficulties, both within the established democracies as well as outside them &ndash;engendering disaffection, disappointment, and sometimes outright rejection. This course does not conceive of democracy as a model, nor seek to identify specific norms and values. It is concerned with democratic argument and experience, across different contexts and cultures: with the varieties of political language that have come to be thought of as democratic or anti-democratic. It takes democracy as a problem in modern politics, not as the utopian answer to its riddles. It will draw on a range of thinkers and theoretical arguments, as well as on the varieties of democratic experiences across historical contexts, in order to question the nature of democracy, both as a form of society and as a type of government. Through such questioning, the course hopes to give students a better comprehension of democracy, of its fragilities and its limits, as well as its compelling political and imaginative potency. It is a course in political analysis and argument, which uses history and deploys historical examples to illuminate some of the urgent current predicaments of democracy.</p>\n\n<p>Sunil Khilnani</p>\n\n<p>Thu/Fri: 16.50-18.20</p>\n\n<p>Cap: 50<br />\nEmail: sunil.khilnani@ashoka.edu.in</p>\n</div></div>"

We will break down each model used to teach Evolutionary Psychology to critically examine each system, and each system feeds into a larger understanding of what is involved in the evolution of cognitive abilities. This course looks at the question of whether there are aspects of behaviour and cognition that do and do not seem to have evolved in particular evolutionary contexts.</p>\n\n<p>The first step in our critical examination is to understand what evolution does and does not mean in a Darwinian framework; as well as whether and how cognition can be defined and accurately assessed. We look at what aspects of behaviour are hardwired, and what is plastic. We understand that evolution pertains to genetic changes, and get a quick understanding of what genetics constitutes. We then learn about epigenetics, gene expression, how the framework of genes and their expression drives physiological development of an embryo, how the brain develops as a subset of the body from a genetic framework, and about the relative ridigity and plasticity of parts of the brain during development and in adulthood. We then visit various questions in evolutionary cognition, focussing on the historical debates between the people who began extending the framework of evolution to understand behaviour and cognition.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The learning goals for this class are to primarily learn how to distinguish an evidence-based understanding of evolutionary cognition from what have been called &ldquo;just-so&rdquo; stories, which clog the public and even scientific realm.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Classes will be structured with lectures interspersed with discussions and student presentations. Students will take responsibility for presenting specific papers and sections of books to the rest of the class. This will be a reading and discussion-heavy course.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The main expectation of students is that they pay full attention in class, alerting the TF or me, through class discussions or by posting on discussion fora&nbsp;if there is anything they do not understand. Piazza posts are encouraged to be public, so that other students can benefit from reading responses to questions asked, although they can certainly be anonymous.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This class will have one assignment and one presentation per student in class, where you can chose a topic to research and critically analyse the literature on the issue and develop your thinking on the question. Students can choose between a presentation and assignment format for their third submission. Each submission, whether assignment or presentation, will count for 30% each of your final grade.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Your participation in class or even by email will count towards the remaining 10%. This means that attendance is in some sense graded. Also note that your participation during presentations carry more weight than participation in other classes. The breakdown of this 10% is: 2% sharing of all presentations and assignments on piazza, 2% attentive listening, 4% attendance, 2% general participation in class or outside class during the semester (note that participation is calculated relative to the maximum participation score).</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Attendance: will be marked as a component of the participation grade. Missing class is a student&rsquo;s loss and will have a marginal impact on the class participation grades. For students who miss class for unavoidable reasons, they can come to me during office hours for help.</p>\n</div></div>"

Some studies that are considered seminal in the field of communication were originally conducted by psychologists, e.g. works by Hovland, Bandura, Lasswell, Lewin, Festinger and Fishbein. The two disciplines continue to enrich and enhance each other such that there are many common publication platforms, partnerships among scholars, and common faculty across departments. In terms of the historical evolution of the two fields psychology is an older and more established discipline than communication, hence communication continues to draw on the more consolidated approaches of psychology.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Learning Outcomes</p>\n\n<p>Understand the historical development of Mass Communication theories and how they link with historically important social, political and&nbsp;technological developments in the field of communication</p>\n\n<p>Develop an understanding of the most often used theories of mass communication and the ability to apply them in research and practice</p>\n\n<p>Critically evaluate theories as applied to practical mass communication problems e.g. media portrayals of sex and violence</p>\n\n<p>Understand how mass communication is a powerful tool of persuasion and how it has been and continues to be used across sectors - adverstising, politics, development etc.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Reading materials will be shared with students at the beginning of the semester either as a compendium for the entire semester or in batches arranged according to major theoretical traditions in communication theory.</p>\n\n<p>Some easy reads&nbsp;that students might find useful:</p>\n\n<p>A First Look at Communication Theory by EM Griffin</p>\n\n<p>Mass Communication Theory by Dennis McQuail</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Class participation:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15%<br />\nBrief written critique of selected readings/quiz/other weekly assignments:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20%<br />\nPresentations:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20%<br />\nMid-term paper:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20%<br />\nFinal paper:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25%</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Students should not miss more than 2 class sessions as we will cover a lot of material in each session.

Put simply, we will ask what is the work done by concepts and whether they enrich or impoverish our understanding of social relationships. In a second move, the course will pick up forms of inquiry, such as definitions and factual descriptions to show how concepts appear. Do they point us to some abstract essence, or are they central to how we live our everyday lives? In negotiating with the above and in consultation with students of the class the course will address any three the following questions.</p>\n\n<p>How do we establish proof? What is the value of the archive and the library in arriving at verity.</p>\n\n<p>Are there rules for the study of social facts?</p>\n\n<p>How do we delimit the rationality of science and politics?</p>\n\n<p>Are commodities bundles of social relatedness?</p>\n\n<p>How are distinctions established in society, and what is the significance of hierarchy in establishing social privilege?</p>\n\n<p>Is social power a relationship and what is its link to order and disorder?</p>\n\n<p>Can the secular be separated from the sacred?</p>\n\n<p>What is the force of visual images?

Nearly every aspect about&nbsp;them is disputed &ndash; from their role in &ldquo;feeding the world&rdquo; and their impacts with respect to yield and environment to regulatory policies and peoples&rsquo; notions of choice and ethics. This course examines the GM debate by looking at the transformations of agriculture and agricultural sciences in the 20th century. It analyzes how private industry has sought profits from agriculture, and the consequent impacts on farming communities. This will help us grasp deeper issues that are often lost in heated anti/pro-GM arguments. Surveying controversies in India, the USA and other parts of the world, the course will demonstrate how the GM debate is shaped by the inter-related shifts in law, politics, and science. By way of examining the case of Bt cotton, Golden Rice, Bt brinjal&nbsp;among others, the course ultimately invites the question: Where do GM crops fit in the landscape of the burning issues faced by the average farmer, if at all?</p>\n\n<p>More broadly, the questions we will consider in this class are, in fact, relevant to most technologies incident upon agriculture, and on the relationship between technology and society, in general.

So much so that one often wonders if and to what extent anthropology&nbsp;is&nbsp;method? This course explores the relationships between anthropology and ethnography and those between question and method in the making of the discipline. Indeed, in some ways, the course could also have been named Anthropology&#39;s Questions. Here are some other questions we will ask: What might it mean to have an anthropological imagination or an ethnographic sensibility? How are they related? Where does the field of fieldwork begin and end and how does one find it? What is the relationship between a &#39;site&#39; and &#39;sight&#39; in constituting the field? How else does one sense the field? How long does it take to arrive at and exist in the everyday and how does one exit? How does one deal with questions of subjects and objects, subjectivity and objectivity, intimacy and scale, the actual and the virtual, power and privilege, anonymity and representation, originality and authenticity? How does one go about uncovering and establishing relationships in practice? What is the role of comparison in anthropology? What does it mean to move relationally and comparatively in conceptual and empirical terms? What are the different ways in which anthropologists approach &#39;the field&#39; and &#39;the archive&#39;? How does one go about conducting fieldwork and composing an ethnography? What are disciplinary codes and conventions, how are they established, when are they broken? In what ways might the limitations of anthropology&#39;s methods expand our imagination of its very possibilities? &nbsp;Over the semester, this course will attempt to address these and other questions through close reading, discussion and debates on a range of anthropological texts and texts on anthropology and its methods. Students will also complete a series of methodological exercises and assignments, including crafting a short research proposal and paper.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

The course also surveys some contemporary perspectives on the discourse and practice of development, such as participatory development, the &ldquo;good governance&rdquo; agenda, and the &ldquo;institutional turn.&rdquo; This is a multidisciplinary social science course, drawing on &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; and &ldquo;critical&rdquo; literature from development studies, geography, anthropology, and sociology. We should note at the outset that development is not static, and that it has long been impelled by both practical and theoretical concerns. It has also been and continues to be shaped by geopolitical interests and social scientific trends that are not immediately tied to development. Bearing this in mind, we shall seek to answer the following key questions this semester: What is development? How have our ideas about development, its causes, and its objectives changed over time? Why, after 60 years of development, are so many people still suffering from poverty, economic decline, ill health, political insecurity, repression, and powerlessness? Where should we focus our development efforts in the future?</p>\n\n<p>Goals</p>\n\n<p>This course is intended to survey the major debates that have occurred within development studies over the past 60 years.

Family lineages developed to be one of the pivotal institutions in organizing local society in late imperial China. These institutions were an important factor in state-society relations, property ownership, infrastructure projects, personal relations, and ritual practice. This course overviews major studies of the historical development of family lineages, its geographic diversity, and their continued existence today as well as their relation to issues of gender, ethnicity, religion, and kinship.<br />\n<br />\nThe first section gives a general overview of Confucian thought with an emphasis on its understanding of kinship and ritual. Section two moves onto historical anthropological studies of the development of family lineages, their related institutional structures (lineage halls) and rituals (ancestor veneration), and their connection to broader social, political, and economic life. Finally, we end the course with ethnographic studies of family lineages in the modern world to consider the impact of the nation-state, urbanization, changes in family dynamics, and transnational communication have had on the lineage.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Section 1: Kinship and Ritual in Confucian Thought and Imperial Power</em></strong><br />\nThis section of the course focuses on Confucian theories of kinship and ritual followed by an overview of the role of these ideas in the structuring of the state and society. The purpose of these theories was different than modern academic works as the aim was to influence how people acted rather than explain what they already were doing. However, they also present an indigenous understanding of these concepts and how the literati elite used them to analyze social issues.<br />\n<br />\n<strong><em>Section 2: Historical Anthropology, Family Lineage, and Local Society</em></strong><br />\nHistorical anthropology emerged in China in response to largely ahistorical orientalist ethnographies of Chinese societies that saw the lineage structure as a monolith and largely drew on existing theories of lineage from European colonies in Africa as well as nationalist histories that presented a unified Chinese culture. In contrast to such studies, historical anthropologists combine fieldwork and local historical documents to analyze the diverse ways that family lineage developed throughout China. Historical anthropology emerged in China in response to largely ahistorical orientalist ethnographies of Chinese societies that saw the lineage structure as a monolith and largely drew on existing theories of lineage from European colonies in Africa as well as nationalist histories that presented a unified Chinese culture. In contrast to such studies, historical anthropologists combine fieldwork and local historical documents to analyze the diverse ways that family lineage developed throughout China.<br />\n<br />\n<em><strong>Section 3: Ethnography, Lineage, and Modernity</strong></em><br />\nThe twentieth century saw the end of dynastic China and with it the bureaucracy staffed by scholar-officials trained in the Confucian tradition. Despite the numerous attacks on traditional culture and the land reform movement that stripped lineages of their land holdings in this period, many lineages throughout China continue to this day. This section focuses on ethnographic studies of how the family lineage has responded to many of the changing social, political, and geographic issues in this period.</p>\n</div></div>"

Who travels and why? What makes travel possible?</p>\n\n<p>I.&nbsp;What is travel?&nbsp;This module will explore the conceptual underpinnings of notions of travel, tourism and pilgrimage. From Victor and Edith Turner to Simon Coleman, from Dean MacCannell and Nelson Graburn to Noel Salazar, many have tried to approach tourism and pilgrimage as an anthropological subject. Travel is clearly a necessary part of a tradition of religious experience. Typically, defined as a journey, pilgrimage is thought to have transformative effects. Unlike permanent migration, it is assumed to be transient. But are all forms of transient travel or journeys pilgrimage? Then what is the difference between tourism and pilgrimage? Is pilgrimage religious tourism or tourism a secular pilgrimage? Is the pilgrim a figure of modernity and the tourist a figure of postmodernity, or is the divide between the two wholly false? As the lines between the two become increasingly blurred, and as tourists travel to attend sports events and music festivals, how do we, as anthropologists, theorise all this?</p>\n\n<p>II.&nbsp;Who travels and why?&nbsp;This module will probe the motivations for travel, and the embodied and embedded practices of tourism and pilgrimage. Why do people travel? To find meaning, for self-expression, or as a form of leisure? What are the perceptions that impel and are produced by travel? We will explore how the tourist gaze, a notion given by John Urry, is shaped and manifested. Yet, not everyone is in a position to travel. How do we treat travel and tourism, which come with assumptions of privilege, differently from exile and forced movement? We will draw on anthropological literature as well as fiction, film, and travel memoirs to give students insights into this topic.</p>\n\n<p>II.&nbsp;What makes travel possible?&nbsp;Here, we will look at the infrastructures of travel, tourism and pilgrimage. Wolfgang Schivelbusch&rsquo;s classic work&nbsp;The Railway Journey&nbsp;is one example of a study of industrialized consciousness facilitated by railways, which in turn made possible travel imaginaries. As people now move to adventure and eco-tourism, or conversely, turn towards virtual pilgrimage events, how do we write about the infrastructures of travel?</p>\n</div></div>"

We make our homes on the bones of what came before. Ruins are that detritus &ndash; physical, conceptual, ideological - that stays with us into the present and, as they do so, bring together disparate points in time. They can be sources of melancholy, inspiration, wonder, and horror. They include both the ruined castles and temples that the word initially calls to mind as well as other elements: lingering toxins in the soil, racist legacies of colonialism, nationalistic points of collective sentiment, and the remnants of past cities bleeding through into the present-day urban landscape.</p>\n\n<p>This course will examine ruins from an anthropological lens. We will address the construction and poetics of space and place, moments when former ways of being in or conceiving of space bleed into the present, and the legacies of empires long gone (or not-so-long gone).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Students should come out of this class with an introduction to the relationship between space and place and a new appreciation for urban infrastructures and their legacies.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Suggested Readings:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Abu-El Haj, Nadia. 2001.

Failure to attend class will result in a grade penalty. A good participant is neither a wallflower nor a boor, he or she engages in the discussion, responds thoughtfully, and seeks to contribute to, not dominate the conversation. You can earn participation points by engaging in a constructive manner with the readings and with the comments of other students.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pr&eacute;cis (30% of grade): </strong>Each week that readings are assigned, you are expected to email me a one-page (appx 200 word) pr&eacute;cis of one of the readings. This will summarize a particular point from the reading that you found compelling or wished to challenge. In addition, please provide one to two questions for discussion. These can be within the pr&eacute;cis or separate. The pr&eacute;cis are due Sunday night by midnight. No extensions will be given. Please copy the text of your pr&eacute;cis into an email and send it to: andrewjohnson@princeton.edu .</p>\n\n<p>Pr&eacute;cis are graded on a simple scale:<br />\n3 &ndash; Shows clear understanding and engagement with the text. Brings a new angle or outside perspective. A clear sense of the student&rsquo;s own voice.</p>\n\n<p>2 &ndash; Understands and correctly summarizes a key point from the text.</p>\n\n<p>1 &ndash; Confused, incorrect or incomplete understanding of the text. (But at least this student read).</p>\n\n<p>0 &ndash; Did not turn in assignment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Oral Presentation (10% of grade)</strong>: There are two components to this grade. The first is a student-led presentation on one of the week&rsquo;s readings. You will sign up for one such presentation on the first class day and become an expert on that reading. Then, in class, you will lead the discussion for appx. 30 minutes. Do note that you don&rsquo;t need to lecture on the reading, rather, you will be the &lsquo;hub&rsquo; of the discussion for that time.</p>\n\n<p>The second component involves the week&rsquo;s &ldquo;activity&rdquo;. On the first class day, you will sign up for one of the weeks featuring an activity, and on that week, you will give a presentation following the week&rsquo;s instructions of about 20 minutes. Do note that not all weeks have activities. Please stick to the 10-minute time. You may have handouts or Powerpoint (or Prezi) classroom technology permitting, but do not simply read off of the presentation &ndash; treat the presentation as an opportunity to briefly teach the class, and try to be engaging. You do not need to hand in anything for the oral presentation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Midterm Essay (20%) and Final Essay (30%): </strong>There are two long-form, take-home essays in this class. These will be assigned at the midterm and at the end of the course. These will be capped at 4,000 words and 6,000 words, maximum, respectively. We will discuss the grading rubric for these papers beforehand, but here I should note that an &ldquo;A&rdquo; paper should show both an in-depth understanding of at least some of the readings for class as well as your own original analysis.</p>\n\n<p>These essays are to be sent as Word document attachments (or in a similar format) to andrew.johnson@ashoka.edu.in by 5PM on the day that they are due.</p>\n </div></div>"

Over the past few decades, critical scholarship on disaster and vulnerability has grown significantly, drawing on, among others, frameworks of political economy and political ecology. At the same time, hazards and disasters have also become increasingly frequent and destructive across the planet. From mega events such as tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, nuclear accidents and oil spills to slow-onset disasters like air pollution, desertification, epidemics, soil erosion and sea level rise, disaster has come to define the times that we live in. Climate change has made matters worse. The impact of a disaster is uneven, however; some people are much more vulnerable than others.</p>\n\n<p>This course is aimed at providing students critical perspectives on disaster and vulnerability. We will begin with an overview of concepts such as risk, hazards, disaster, vulnerability, and resilience. Drawing on case studies from around the world, the course will then expose students to a variety of political and cultural questions concerning disaster and vulnerability. The students will learn about, among others, the role of the state and capital in the production of disaster and hazardscape; how vulnerability is a social calculus; ideas of climate coloniality and climate justice; how various societies in different historical moments have responded to calamity, offering insight into the complex relationships between societies and their natural environments; and how disaster management efforts can promote widespread resilience or increase the vulnerability of some populations, thereby further deepening societal inequities. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

The course is theoretically rigorous and empirically grounded.&nbsp;It covers a wide range of issues, including the classical agrarian question, contemporary agrarian debates, green revolution and its legacies, the question(s) of food, land and water grabbing, farmer suicides in India, gender and agriculture, transnational peasant movements, and the recent farmers protest in India. This course will be run as a seminar, which means students will be expected to actively participate in class discussions.

As cities become even more central to social experience and aspiration, we need to understand their place in history and in the human imagination. This course looks at cities through three thematic lenses: accumulation, order, and identity. It studies cities in relation to the countryside, tracing flows of people and goods that create wealth and poverty. It examines the spatial politics of managing urban populations, from planning to informality. It analyses cities as places where cultural identities &ndash; parochial and progressive &ndash; are formed and defended. It introduces urban studies as a critical area of sociology and anthropology, and as an essential prerequisite for understanding environmental politics.</p>\n</div></div>"

What are the forces that shape the lives and practices of individuals referred to in public discourse as craftsmen, or &lsquo;folk &lsquo;and &lsquo;tribal&rsquo; artists in post -colonial India? How much agency do they have over their lives and practice and to what extent are they &lsquo;manipulated&rsquo; by &lsquo;outside&rsquo; mediations? And how do tradition and modernity parley with each other in the shaping of their work and careers? This course is designed to make students actively debate and engage with these issues and beyond, through case studies of practitioners of both material and performative practices from Central India. It&nbsp;&nbsp;examines trajectories in artisanal and performative practices from the region of Madhya Pradesh and the recently created state of Chhattisgarh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The course will acquaint students with case histories of practitioners, from the ground,&nbsp;&nbsp;to trace trajectories of transformation. Students will engage with questions of caste and community, agency, selfhood, and gender, to understand the shaping of art forms and their contexts. They will be led to look at&nbsp;&nbsp;shifting contexts for the production&nbsp;&nbsp;and reception of art practices, examining&nbsp;&nbsp;the role of the state, museums and institutions, exhibitions and the market in creating binary categories of &lsquo;art&rsquo; verses &lsquo;craft&rsquo;. A key component will be unravelling histories and modes of intervention following developmental or anthropological paradigms in the field.</p>\n\n<p>Discussions will be largely based on films and video recordings from the &lsquo;field&rsquo;, interviews, exhibition catalogues and on- site visits to the crafts museum&nbsp;&nbsp;and art galleries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Course Structure and modules</strong></p>\n\n<p>The course syllabus&nbsp;focuses on the following set of practices and forms from Central&nbsp;India. It follows developments in the lives of practitioners and their practice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Modules</strong></p>\n\n<p>&lsquo;Gond&rsquo; art</p>\n\n<p>In 2001, the artist Jangarh Singh Shyam committed suicide at a Museum in Japan, unable to return home before&nbsp;&nbsp;paintings that had been&nbsp;&nbsp;commissioned by the Museum&nbsp;&nbsp;were completed. He was a Gond Pradhan,&nbsp;&nbsp;from an &lsquo;adivasi&#39;&nbsp;community in Central India, famously &lsquo;discovered&rsquo; by the art world in 1981. This module charts his life and art through films, art works and publications and examines the role of played by art world interlocutors in shaping his life and career.&nbsp;Lectures will look at&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Gond art &lsquo; as&nbsp;&nbsp;a tradition that was &lsquo;invented&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;in recent times, and look at individuals who followed Jangarh Singh Shaym to trace trajectories in their practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will also look at&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;primitivism&rsquo; as a phenomenon in 20th&nbsp;century modern art&nbsp;&nbsp;to unpack ideologies that informed the discovery of &lsquo;adivasi&rsquo; artists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Rajwar clay sculpture&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Valorised as a woman sculptor whose art was born of loneliness, Sona Bai&rsquo;s life changed completely after her discovery by teams from Bharat Bhavan, an&nbsp;art intitution based in&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhopal. Her art which was made from local clay found in&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarguja in Chhattisgarh&nbsp;&nbsp;shaped into sculptures and screens, began to&nbsp;&nbsp;adorn museums and exhibition spaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did this shift from a domestic space&nbsp;&nbsp;in the interiors of Chhattisgarh to sites of international exhibition do to her art and how much agency did she have in shaping her life or work? Which markets defined her work&nbsp;&nbsp;as individualistic&nbsp;&nbsp;art practice and which defined it as&nbsp;&nbsp;craft born of women&rsquo;s labour?&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens when her work, which was domestic and therefore private,&nbsp;&nbsp;enters a larger public sphere for staging ethnicities? Students will look at films, exhibition catalogues and in situ installations to understand her art and that of others who followed her.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Gadhwa metal sculpture, Bastar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The module will&nbsp;&nbsp;focus on the transformation of&nbsp;&nbsp;metal sculptures from Bastar, from objects of ritual use to highly sought after objects in the art market.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jaidev Baghel, metal sculptor from Bastar, was able to negotiate a space for himself across markets, moving between art worlds and sites for the marketing of&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;crafts. Students will look at his work and that of the modernist sculptor Meera Mukherjee&nbsp;&nbsp;who apprenticed under him to see how both practices changed through the interaction. They will also examine how the idea of the &lsquo;folk&rsquo; feeds into ideas of authenticity and nationality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Between ethnography and anthropology&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>How have ethnography and anthropology as disciplines shaped the work of largely urban based individuals and institutions to inform interventions in the field?&nbsp;&nbsp;Students will look at the work of the anthropologist&nbsp;Verrier Elwin, artist and adminsitrator&nbsp;&nbsp;J . Swaminathan, photographer Sunil Janah, culture activist Pupul Jaykar, artists Meera Mukherjee, Navjot Altaf&nbsp;to raise questions about ethics and intentionality. &lsquo;</p>\n\n<p>Performative practices</p>\n\n<p>This module looks at&nbsp;&nbsp;shifts in the performances of the&nbsp;Pandvani, (stories of the Pandavas recited in Chhattisgarh), and the&nbsp;Lorik Chanda&nbsp;, tracing the emergence of&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;professional artists&rsquo; and the shifts from oral to textual sources of storytelling. What are emic understadigns of this shift ? Student will also looks at &lsquo;Nacha&rsquo; a form of theatre that became popular in Chhattisgarh in the early years of the twentieth century, examining interventions by Habib Tanvir, well known&nbsp;modernist theatre director,&nbsp;&nbsp;and the trope of&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;indigenism&rsquo; in modernist art discourse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Subalternity in Chhattisgarh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This module will focus on practices that define subalternity in this region, and their resistance to the culture of upper caste communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these are highly charged performative practices that have, so far,&nbsp;&nbsp;also resisted being co- opted into mainstream culture. One of the most compelling of these are the Ramnamis, a community that perform&nbsp;&nbsp;bhakti and resist upper caste practices by tattooing their bodies with the name of the divine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Discusssion themes include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>the&nbsp;&nbsp;performance of oral epics (Pandvani&nbsp;and&nbsp;Lorik Chanda), by stellar performers from this region and their adaptation by the modernist theatre director and activist Habeeb Tanvir.</li>\n\t<li>the life and art of&nbsp;&nbsp;Jangarh Singh Shyam, painter from Patangarh, Madhya Pradesh and the phenomenon of &lsquo;Gond painting&rsquo;.</li>\n\t<li>performing identities of &lsquo;artist &lsquo;and &lsquo;craftsperson&rsquo; in the lives and practice of modernist sculptor Meera Mukherjee and&nbsp;&nbsp;Jaidev Baghel, metal sculptor from Bastar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>the role of key museums and institutions in the &lsquo;discovery&rsquo; of art forms and&nbsp;&nbsp;the creation of&nbsp;&nbsp;exhibition paradigms.(Bharat Bhavan, Crafts Museum, Tribal Museum)&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>the role of interlocutors from art worlds, such as J.&nbsp;&nbsp;Swaminathan, Bhasakar Kulkarni , Pupul Jaykar etc and their impact in transforming practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>seeking the indigenous in the &lsquo;folk .</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>this course will enable students to&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>trace&nbsp;&nbsp;shifts in art practices of marginalised constituencies in post- independence India.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>debate the binaries of &lsquo;art&rsquo; and &lsquo;craft &lsquo; as categories created within different social and institutional contexts.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>debate the nature&nbsp;&nbsp;and extent of agency&nbsp;&nbsp;exercised by creative persons from marginalised communities.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>re imagine modes for alternative interventions in art practice.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Themes outlined in the readings below will inform discussions on the modules listed above.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Central India: mapping the field&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Gregory, Christopher A. &quot;Chhattisgarh: At the crossroads.&quot;&nbsp;The Modern Anthropology of India.

Or on a terrain? How are people produced by such mapping? What anxieties drive the imperial cartographic impulse? What pressures does terra nullis exert in situ? What do the bodies produced in mapped territories look like? What bodies exist in unmapped terrains? What is the relationship between wonder/amazement, and control/annihilation? Where do we locate ourselves as scholars reading these maps? What maps are visible when we visit the landscape? How are narratives produced against maps? How are histories made visible in terrain?</p>\n\n<p>These questions will guide us as we traverse a theoretical terrain of writings on space and territory, and situate ourselves in specific historical moments of imperial mastery over space. We will cover a lot of ground temporally but our geographic focus will be South and East Asia. In this class we will develop skills in reading and understanding the genre of the academic monograph; in understanding how they relate to each other; and in analyzing the theoretical and methodological bases and trends of these works.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Summarize academic monographs in South and East Asian studies and introduce salient points in notes and in speech.</p>\n\n<p>Be able to draw connections between works to gain an overview of scholarly and historiographical debates.</p>\n\n<p>Be able to trace theoretical or methodological trends across multiple empirical contexts.</p>\n\n<p>Analyze and present in writing your interpretation of the role of space and place in a geographical region relevant to your work or interest.</p>\n\n<p>Learn the skills of co-writing and co-presenting to gain a sense of how cooperative work can integrate intellectual property as well as collective clarity.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>You are not required to purchase any materials for this course. All readings will be provided in PDF via email.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Assessment &amp; Assignments:</p>\n\n<p>40% - Leading weekly discussion in class and participating in class discussions</p>\n\n<p>60% - Carto-Paper (Optional Team Project)</p>\n\n<p>Attendance, Participation and Discussion Etiquette :</p>\n\n<p>I will not take attendance in each class meeting, however, participation in weekly class discussions is a mandatory part of your grade and is necessary for succeeding in the course. If you have circumstances that might affect attendance at a specific class meeting, please let me know ahead of time whenever possible. Flexibility is especially important since Covid is still with us. To protect your privacy, please do not describe any medical situations to me; just inform me that the situation exists and be prepared to provide a doctor&rsquo;s note if requested.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Participation is part of your grade, and should be based on attentive reading, listening, and preparation. Participation can take many forms. Always keep an open mind and be respectful of your classmates and your instructor regardless of what you wish to say, or whether you agree with what has already been said. Being respectful also means that (1) if you have not completed a particular reading, please refrain from commenting on it (2) in the normal course of discussion, if you have just spoken, you should refrain from speaking again until others who wish to contribute have done so (3) contributions to discussion should be based on the readings, lectures, and discussion questions, and should aim to improve our collective understanding of them. In general, please avoid unstructured/unsupported reflections as well as topics that are beyond the scope of the course.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Class lead:</p>\n\n<p>One student per week (both Tuesday and Thursday) will introduce the assigned readings for that week (~10 mins) and facilitate discussion for the rest of the class. Try to keep your presentation to under ten minutes, and use the time to provide a short summary of one or two of the assigned texts, and present to the class your own questions and ideas about the theme through the readings. This exercise will help you condense the readings to their core argument and thereby facilitate review before assignments are due. For this reason, it makes sense to approach every set of readings with a few basic questions: who is the author? What is his or her background? What kind of audience are they addressing? And what is the aim of the text? Is it a purely technical piece of writing or does it raise (or hide?) important political questions? These questions are very basic, but they will help you to structure your contribution to the class. If you would like to additionally discuss reading material or resources not on the reading list in your presentation, please feel free to discuss your ideas for the presentation with me beforehand. Following the week&rsquo;s discussion, the class lead will collate all the notes for the assigned readings, to structure them into an annotated entry for each text we have read.</p>\n\n<p>Carto-paper:</p>\n\n<p>This assignment will be a 5500-6000 word (Times New Roman 12 pt. font, double-spaced, not including footnotes and bibliography) investigation of a single primary source relevant to the field of cartography, broadly construed: this can be a specific map, a surveyor&rsquo;s field diary, an object history of a technical instrument, etc. Feel free to discuss your ideas or adjustments, if you prefer, for this project with me beforehand. You may also turn this into a collaborative project if you wish. Your carto-paper is due 11.59 pm May 14, by email to me. We will be discussing two drafts of your paper as a class. These two drafts are due on Monday 11.59 pm February 20 and April 3, by email. Following your submissions, we will intensively workshop everyone&rsquo;s paper as a group. In these group discussions, you will be expected to have read your peers&rsquo; work (as you would when you will attend conferences, workshops, and panel discussions), and offer constructive feedback to help your peers make progress on their projects. Your participation in these discussions will count towards your final grade for the carto-paper.</p>\n\n<p>These essays are an important way to develop your writing skills&mdash;particularly the formation of a clear and logical argument, the mobilization of evidence, and the quality of prose. Your essays are intended to help you build the specific skill of making a historical argument, and to that end they should be erudite, specific, supportable and argumentative&mdash;not an unstructured reflection, opinion, or summary. They must refer, when needed, to the readings with citations.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Late submissions will not be accepted. If you anticipate that for any reason you will be unable to make these deadlines, please email me at least 48 hours in advance for an extension.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Your essays must aim to illuminate the texts you have chosen to discuss, rather than simply critique them or identify the gaps in the knowledge of the authors. The effectiveness of your arguments will rest on your plausible articulation of positions and paradigms of thinking that you may be unfamiliar or even disagree with. Thus, both your essays and the feedback you offer your peers should attempt to first reconstruct the carefully considered and rigorously formulated thoughts and arguments of the authors you are reading, before seeking to push that comprehension in a new direction.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/536ea63f-1411-4b82-9f68-3464d5362257.docx' download='Borderlands 2023 syllabus and weekly schedule.docx'>Borderlands 2023 syllabus and weekly schedule.docx</a></td></tr></table></div></div>"

While photographic images&nbsp;stand&nbsp;for&nbsp;real/truth of an image, ie,&nbsp;&#39;this exists&#39; in a moment in time, it is also a framing device; it is an apparatus that lends itself to&nbsp;re-presentation and reproduction of an image.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While a still image captures the fleeting momentary aspect of a world we live in, it represents this moment in specific ways. It reproduces this moment, frames it and imbues it with the subjectivity of the photographer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is this aspect of photography that this assignment explores, especially in relation to early photographic folios, albums and other incunabula as Walter Benjamin points out to us.</p>\n\n<p>Note:&nbsp; Sequentiality and Repetition could be utilised to hold certain directorial vision or poetic aspects to the narrative. Also you could utilise&nbsp;the inherent qualities of a photograph- that a photograph&nbsp;manages to capture&nbsp;a fleeting moment of a second (shutter speeds), as well as varying qualities of light (aperture);&nbsp;&nbsp;it captures certain frames that human eye cannot capture, including a point of view where human eye may not be able to reach.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Module 3: Photography and Identities:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This module will address the complex lines of the real and the fictional in relation to photographic images. The two readings will address the forms and formations of identity and the political nature of representation, distribution and circulation of photographic images.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The module will emphasise on aspects of photography that spill into the amateur, the cinematic, and the everyday. Its ubiquitous aspects will be explored through various lenses.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The practice exercise will be a way for students to address the complex space of creating meanings and identities through photographs.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tableaux Vivant and Photography. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Photography and Anthropology,</p>\n\n<p>Archival Practices and Photography.</p>\n\n<p>Artists References:</p>\n\n<p>Hippolyte Bayard,&nbsp; Marcel Duchamp, Homai Vyarawalla, Helmut Newton, N.

It will focus on some of the dominant traditions of historical writing, and the internal dialogues within the traditions. It will move from positivism to critical theory, from Marxism to the Annales, from the French historical tradition to English social history, from Foucault&rsquo;s discursive turn to Michel de Certeau&rsquo;s focus on everyday practice. Through this journey, we will reflect on some of the binaries that often shape historical thinking &ndash;&ndash; the questions of history and myth, certainty and ambiguity, objectivity and prejudice, truth and falsehood &ndash;&ndash; and see how these notions are questioned and rethought over time.</p>\n\n<p>If historians in the nineteenth century established some of the founding premises of the historian&rsquo;s craft, the &lsquo;critical turn&rsquo; from the 1970s has powerfully questioned many of these assumptions, underlining the complex nature of historical practice. It has persuaded historians to ask: what does it mean to enter the archive and mine the traces of the past, to read the record, to see and represent, to narrate, and to write a story based on evidence? This course will explore what this critical turn has meant to the writing of history, how it has forced historians to question earlier frames, and opened up new worlds of research.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>THEMES AND LECTURES:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Introduction: On Reading History</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>I: MODERNITY AND HISTORICAL KNOWEDGE</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>1) Ranke, Acton and the Shaping of the Historical Discipline</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; Readings:</strong></p>\n\n<p>G.

Seeking answers to these questions, this course brings in dialogue the works of art with the spaces that such works have come to inhabit in our present world &ndash; museums, art galleries, and other spaces of visual exhibitions. Moving beyond the established trajectories of looking at exhibitions, museums, and gallery spaces as&nbsp;storehouses of masterpieces of Art, or merely as spaces of ordering, classifying, and displaying objects and images, we will look closely at how exhibition practices of&nbsp;museums and public art galleries, constitute the very category &ldquo;Art&rdquo; around a select body of objects and images.</p>\n\n<p>Beginning with early modern royal and notable private collections, and cabinet of curiosities across the world, the course will explore the specific moments of the coming into being of public museums and art galleries through fairs, &ldquo;freak shows&rdquo;, and world exhibitions in Europe and across different parts of the world. It will explore how politics of collection, museum acquisition, display, and repatriation are tied with larger questions of colonialism, war, loot, postcolonial nationalist reassertions, and postwar encounters with race and ethnicity.&nbsp;With a specific focus on Asia, the course will map the connected global trajectories of museums, art galleries and memorials as dense narratives of unfolding spatial and temporal complexes. In the process it will highlight the role of the artists, curators, and museum/ gallery visitors in the production of a complex set of dialogues around artistic, and curatorial visions.</p>\n\n<p>The course will end by looking at contemporary South Asia, mapping the challenges of redesigning exhibition orders of older museums and art institutions and spread of museum modes of display and viewing, with different intent, in commemorative sites, theme parks, memorials, and new temples. This co-constitution of art and art museums will be addressed during class discussions and during visits to local galleries, museums, theme parks, and temples &ndash; to&nbsp;the Indian Museum, Kolkata, the National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi the National Museum, New Delhi, the National Handloom and Handicrafts Musem, New Delhi, the Rashtriya Dalit Prerna Sthal, Nodia, the Swaminarayan Akshardham Complex, New Delhi, the British Museum, London and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>On successful completion of the course, we will be able to:</p>\n\n<p>a) Explore the main trends in the development of Art History, Visual Culture and Museum Studies by accessing the critical essential skills.</p>\n\n<p>b) Evaluate the approaches of artists, art historians, and curators to the field of visual arts and museum studies</p>\n\n<p>c) Explore curatorial practices in the art world</p>\n\n<p>d) Develop the interests for a future training in art curatorial programme and critical museum studies.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Course Prerequisites</strong></p>\n\n<p>None</p>\n\n<p><strong>Modules</strong></p>\n\n<p>Introduction to the Scope and Aims of the Course:</p>\n\n<p>Why Museums?

Through classroom discussions, artist guest lectures, and studio visits with Raqs Media Collective, Thukral &amp; Tagra, and ruangrupa, among others, the course will provide a comprehensive idea of what it means to be a collective in the turbulent times that we live in.<br />\n<br />\nFrom the Delhi-based Raqs Media Collective to The Situationist International in Europe, the idea of what constitutes a collective has seen multiple transformations. Collectivism after Modernism, for instance, embraces the heterogeneous character of cultural formations and contests the notions of individual artistic genius. The collectives formed in the wake of the internet, such as Sarai (New Delhi), started thinking beyond the framework of the nation-state with newly networked creative communities. At the same time, there are contemporary art activist collectives like the Gulf Labor Coalition, a temporary group of artists who came together to fight for better labour conditions in the United Arab Emirates.<br />\n<br />\nIn a theoretical and practical approach, the course unpacks how the idea of &lsquo;collective&rsquo; and &lsquo;collectivity&rsquo; continues to evolve across diverse cultural landscapes of South Asia, Aboriginal Australia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Canada and Japan, to mention a few. Drawing from the course learning and interpersonal conversations with the artist collectives, the students will curate an exhibition towards the end of the semester. The premise of this exhibition is to encourage the students to think about their collective roles in the university community.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Course Modules:</strong></p>\n\n<p>What is a Collective? : Introduction to how the idea of collective manifested across the world from the mid-20th to the early 21st century.</p>\n\n<p>Community: Collective and its manifestations in Indigenous and Aboriginal cultures of South Asia, and Australia.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Avant-garde: Discussion on Futurism, Surrealism, Constructivism, the Situationist International, and the Gutai Art Association.</p>\n\n<p>Post-Independent India: Progressive Artists Group, Bombay, Delhi Silpi Chakra, 1890 Group, Indian Radical Sculptors and Painters Association.</p>\n\n<p>Media &amp; Network: Collectives that emerged in the wake of the Internet Jodi Brothers, Raqs Media Collective, RT Mark, and Nettime.</p>\n\n<p>Labor Rights: Introduction to the practices of Gulf Labor Coalition (New York / Abu Dhabi), Art Labor (Ho Chi Minh City), Art Workers&#39; Coalition (New York).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Anti-administration: Discussion on activist groups, Chim&uarr;Pom (Tokyo), Forensic Architecture (London), The Yes Men (New York).</p>\n\n<p>Archive: An overview of the work by CAMP (Mumbai), The Atlas Group (New York), The Otolith Group, Lost Society Document (Taipei), Black Audio and Film Collective (London).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Gender: Conversation on the practices of Guerrilla Girls ( New York), Mai-Thu Perret, The Crystal Frontier (New Mexico), General Idea (Toronto / New York), Pinjra Tod (New Delhi).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Ecology: Discussion on Toxic Links (New Delhi), Carbon Defense League (USA), SUPERFLEX (Copenhagen).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Dissent: Discussions on the political movements of Rhodes Must Fall, Black Lives Matter, and Shaheen Bagh emerged in the wake of the new citizenship bill in India.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Life: A case study of collectivism in Indonesia discussing the activities of ruangrupa.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>By the end of this course, students:</p>\n\n<p>Will be well versed in the idea of collective and collectivism from the mid-20th to the early 21st Century.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Will develop an understanding of art movements such as Futurism, Dadaism, and Surrealism as well as develop an understanding of contemporary art collectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Will understand from a historical perspective the significance and limitations of a collective, especially in the turbulent times we live in.</p>\n\n<p>Will be informed enough to embrace the idea of micro and macro creative collectives within the student community at Ashoka.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Stimson Blake &amp; Sholette Gregory Ed., Collectivism After Modernism: The Art of Social Imagination after 1945, University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, 2004.</p>\n\n<p>Aristarkhova Irina, &lsquo;Internationaleries Collectivism, the Grotesque, and Cold War Functionalism&rsquo;, ibid.</p>\n\n<p>Tomii Reiko,&nbsp; &lsquo;After the &ldquo;Descent to the Everyday&rdquo; Japanese Collectivism from Hi Red Center to The Play, 1964&ndash;1973&rsquo;, ibid.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Moore Alan W, &lsquo;Artists&rsquo; Collectives - Focus on New York, 1975&ndash;2000&rsquo; , ibid.</p>\n\n<p>Enwezor Okwui, &lsquo;The Production of Social Space as Artwork - Protocols of Community in the Work of Le Groupe Amos and Huit Facettes&rsquo;, ibid.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Grant H.

Be it on an interest-based website or platform, or the social media platforms that are constantly pushing towards a stringer visual language. As the schism between the written word and visuals are challenged, often the text is now the new image. In these times visual articulation is making a strong space for itself in every form of information or content, be it journalism, daily expression and even academics. In a post Covid world, much of the health information has moved to a visual plane, similar to explaining economics to the common man amidst the turbulence, or the Refugee crisis in Syria, and many others. The visual approach is now the new language of communication across the spectrum to make an engaged form of communication, information and understanding.</p>\n\n<p>With the advent of social media and personalization of content consumption, visual communication has been fast and consistently evolving. From the black board in the classroom to the white board animations on social media, from informative visual pamphlets to educational comics, the blending of the academic information and the visual articulation, a new platform for educational dissemination and discussion has emerged both in the digital and analogue spaces.</p>\n\n<p>The new forms of information, whether through print or the digital, through picture books to animations to pocket sized visual bites on the mobile, the new visual based forms have found both audience and acceptance. This has now brought forth a demand for content makers and practitioners who are willing to engage with it visually in terms of practice. In the visual world we live now, it is a form with a moving language now blending with technology. This course will blend these influences into ones&rsquo; own academic major to create content that helps demystifying the respective discipline through visual content lime comics, graphic narratives, zines and basic animations to reach out to a wider audience.</p>\n\n<p>Visual led approach for awareness building, information sharing and education has now evolved both as a form and a medium that is now used in every discipline, as an independent genre both in the online and offline worlds. Today the visual form has drawn inspiration and been influenced by multiple disciplines like painting, filmmaking, animations, the printed text, gaming pushing it to the next gen ux/ui platforms. It&rsquo;s this multi-disciplinary influence and framework this course seeks to work with.</p>\n\n<p><u>This course seeks to blend one&rsquo;s academic interest with the omnipresent visual world through storytelling, visual narratives, blending academics and practice with a research led inter-disciplinary approach.</u></p>\n\n<p><strong>What this course is about</strong></p>\n\n<p>Exploring possibilities of visual based information dissemination, visual discussion and engagement, this course plans to engage with extending ones&rsquo; academic learning to visual based practice. Exploring the genre as a tool and a form that can be incorporated in one&rsquo;s individual academic discipline. This approach can help the students in articulating their learnings, research and storytelling in multi-disciplinary formats. In these times when visual storytelling is a pervasive and a popular form of information, opinion and communication, the practice-based engagement will help students open up their learnings to a multi-disciplinary articulation as new age academic content creators.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Course Modules:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The preliminary module of this course of 2 weeks will be a curated overview of the published, popular and the prevalent and emerging forms of visual based information through different genres and mediums. The idea would be exploring the diversity of practice across the globe and the processes involved in content creation of such types. The idea here will be to discuss the forms and works to bring new practice-based influences and ideas, their working process and explore the architecture of visual practice in these works.</p>\n\n<p>Week I &amp; II: Present /discuss works of visual based academic information through presentation, film clips. Present /discuss relevant visual narratives, academic comics, mobile episodes, comic strips, web shows and academic narratives in social media.</p>\n\n<p>This will be a presentation and discussion-based approach discussing the presented works in detail and the stories behind making many of these works. The idea will be to discuss the journey of the works from the intent to execution and the struggles and transformations that make the narrative in the final output. For example, Logicomix, a graphic novel that discusses Bertrand Rusell&rsquo;s works and philosophy through a comic, The Beginner series across various subjects, Medical comics and such that are some of the well-articulated works closer to this course.</p>\n\n<p>This will be followed by 3 weeks to ideate, research, explore ideas of student&rsquo;s interest in their areas of discipline followed by field work, data collection and research on the ground. This will include visual data collection, interviews, recording, documentation and conceptualizing the idea based on the research.</p>\n\n<p>Documentation of the research will be followed to process and distill the findings to create the core conceptual idea and be presented in the studio sessions for the benefit of collective brainstorming and discussions. These discussions with fellow classmates will led to an inter-disciplinary ideation and conceptualization, moving closer to shape and sharpen the core project ideas of the students. The students will also be expected to share the processing of their research findings along with their influences and inspirations.</p>\n\n<p>Moving on from research the course will discuss the working process of creating a visual content using multiple influences of form and genres. Depending on the student&rsquo;s interest and academic major, this 1-week study will include detailed discussions on the various possibilities of the form i.e. different forms that can be explored - doodle narratives, zines, comics, mobile based narratives, photo comics, design, layouts, page architecture, typography, sequential storytelling and the work process involved in each, enabling the students to make informed choices in sync with their ideas.</p>\n\n<p>The following week the students will be expected to present their ideas and preliminary drafts as scribbles/ sketches with fellow batchmates, followed by open discussions, suggestions and ideation to evolve a clear understanding to flesh out the final narrative.</p>\n\n<p>Each student/ project will be further exposed to similar works through display and in-depth discussions on influences and ideas related to the project to lend a visual articulation, enabling the student to take one&rsquo;s academic learnings further.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the semester will move to its last 6 weeks to create 1 visual based academic content.</p>\n\n<p>A mid-sem draft presentation will be shared in the studio to display the work in progress after 2 weeks then followed by the final 4 weeks or the end of the semester, ready for display, presentation and production. Studio presence in these weeks will be a must.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Segmented timeline:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Weeks 1-2: Discuss works of visual based academic information through presentation, film clips, relevant visual narratives, academic comics, mobile episodes, comic strips, web shows and academic narratives in social media.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 3-5: Ideate, research, explore academic themes and its relevant visual mediums.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 7: Conceptualize through possibilities of form, information, medium, architecture etc.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 8: Presentation of idea followed by discussion on similar ideas &amp; influences.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 9-14: Final completion with a mid-semester presentation in week 11.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Total Weeks: 14</strong></p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The semester will be a segmented flow from exploring multiple visual forms and practice like academic graphic novels, mobile episodes, zines, comic strips extending to a practice- based approach in sync with one&rsquo;s academic major.</p>\n\n<p>Through the semester students will learn to negotiate between the visuals and the academic world and dive deep in the process of creating their individual content.

We will try to uncover how individual artistic practices are shaped by popular imagery, art history, and visual culture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In thinking of every day through the prism of theatrical reality, the course encourages inquiry about how can drawings and the act of drawing itself is a dialogue about&nbsp;provisionality, uncertainty, and change. How do artists and artistic explorations address issues of meaning-making and shared history, politics, and culture?</p>\n\n<p>How does the process of repetition, layering, overlapping, erasure, and incision transform an image, leading to alternative perspectives about how we perceive and engage with the known? How can we tell the same story in different media, material, and socio-cultural contexts?</p>\n\n<p>Recognizing the importance of contradictions, ambiguity, and serendipity as integral to processes of meaning-making, students have the flexibility to make interventions that can vary from being poetic, polemic, dramatic, metaphorical, provocative, or incisive.

What are the forces that shape the lives and practices of individuals referred to in public discourse as craftsmen, or &lsquo;folk &lsquo;and &lsquo;tribal&rsquo; artists in post -colonial India? How much agency do they have over their lives and practice and to what extent are they &lsquo;manipulated&rsquo; by &lsquo;outside&rsquo; mediations? And how do tradition and modernity parley with each other in the shaping of their work and careers? This course is designed to make students actively debate and engage with these issues and beyond, through case studies of practitioners of both material and performative practices from Central India. It&nbsp;&nbsp;examines trajectories in artisanal and performative practices from the region of Madhya Pradesh and the recently created state of Chhattisgarh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The course will acquaint students with case histories of practitioners, from the ground,&nbsp;&nbsp;to trace trajectories of transformation. Students will engage with questions of caste and community, agency, selfhood, and gender, to understand the shaping of art forms and their contexts. They will be led to look at&nbsp;&nbsp;shifting contexts for the production&nbsp;&nbsp;and reception of art practices, examining&nbsp;&nbsp;the role of the state, museums and institutions, exhibitions and the market in creating binary categories of &lsquo;art&rsquo; verses &lsquo;craft&rsquo;. A key component will be unravelling histories and modes of intervention following developmental or anthropological paradigms in the field.</p>\n\n<p>Discussions will be largely based on films and video recordings from the &lsquo;field&rsquo;, interviews, exhibition catalogues and on- site visits to the crafts museum&nbsp;&nbsp;and art galleries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Course Structure and modules</strong></p>\n\n<p>The course syllabus&nbsp;focuses on the following set of practices and forms from Central&nbsp;India.

This module charts his life and art through films, art works and publications and examines the role of played by art world interlocutors in shaping his life and career.&nbsp;Lectures will look at&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Gond art &lsquo; as&nbsp;&nbsp;a tradition that was &lsquo;invented&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;in recent times, and look at individuals who followed Jangarh Singh Shaym to trace trajectories in their practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will also look at&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;primitivism&rsquo; as a phenomenon in 20th&nbsp;century modern art&nbsp;&nbsp;to unpack ideologies that informed the discovery of &lsquo;adivasi&rsquo; artists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Rajwar clay sculpture&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Valorised as a woman sculptor whose art was born of loneliness, Sona Bai&rsquo;s life changed completely after her discovery by teams from Bharat Bhavan, an&nbsp;art intitution based in&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhopal. Her art which was made from local clay found in&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarguja in Chhattisgarh&nbsp;&nbsp;shaped into sculptures and screens, began to&nbsp;&nbsp;adorn museums and exhibition spaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did this shift from a domestic space&nbsp;&nbsp;in the interiors of Chhattisgarh to sites of international exhibition do to her art and how much agency did she have in shaping her life or work? Which markets defined her work&nbsp;&nbsp;as individualistic&nbsp;&nbsp;art practice and which defined it as&nbsp;&nbsp;craft born of women&rsquo;s labour?&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens when her work, which was domestic and therefore private,&nbsp;&nbsp;enters a larger public sphere for staging ethnicities? Students will look at films, exhibition catalogues and in situ installations to understand her art and that of others who followed her.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Gadhwa metal sculpture, Bastar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The module will&nbsp;&nbsp;focus on the transformation of&nbsp;&nbsp;metal sculptures from Bastar, from objects of ritual use to highly sought after objects in the art market.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jaidev Baghel, metal sculptor from Bastar, was able to negotiate a space for himself across markets, moving between art worlds and sites for the marketing of&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;crafts. Students will look at his work and that of the modernist sculptor Meera Mukherjee&nbsp;&nbsp;who apprenticed under him to see how both practices changed through the interaction. They will also examine how the idea of the &lsquo;folk&rsquo; feeds into ideas of authenticity and nationality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Between ethnography and anthropology&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>How have ethnography and anthropology as disciplines shaped the work of largely urban based individuals and institutions to inform interventions in the field?&nbsp;&nbsp;Students will look at the work of the anthropologist&nbsp;Verrier Elwin, artist and adminsitrator&nbsp;&nbsp;J . Swaminathan, photographer Sunil Janah, culture activist Pupul Jaykar, artists Meera Mukherjee, Navjot Altaf&nbsp;to raise questions about ethics and intentionality. &lsquo;</p>\n\n<p>Performative practices</p>\n\n<p>This module looks at&nbsp;&nbsp;shifts in the performances of the&nbsp;Pandvani, (stories of the Pandavas recited in Chhattisgarh), and the&nbsp;Lorik Chanda&nbsp;, tracing the emergence of&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;professional artists&rsquo; and the shifts from oral to textual sources of storytelling. What are emic understadigns of this shift ? Student will also looks at &lsquo;Nacha&rsquo; a form of theatre that became popular in Chhattisgarh in the early years of the twentieth century, examining interventions by Habib Tanvir, well known&nbsp;modernist theatre director,&nbsp;&nbsp;and the trope of&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;indigenism&rsquo; in modernist art discourse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Subalternity in Chhattisgarh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This module will focus on practices that define subalternity in this region, and their resistance to the culture of upper caste communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these are highly charged performative practices that have, so far,&nbsp;&nbsp;also resisted being co- opted into mainstream culture. One of the most compelling of these are the Ramnamis, a community that perform&nbsp;&nbsp;bhakti and resist upper caste practices by tattooing their bodies with the name of the divine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Discusssion themes include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>the&nbsp;&nbsp;performance of oral epics (Pandvani&nbsp;and&nbsp;Lorik Chanda), by stellar performers from this region and their adaptation by the modernist theatre director and activist Habeeb Tanvir.</li>\n\t<li>the life and art of&nbsp;&nbsp;Jangarh Singh Shyam, painter from Patangarh, Madhya Pradesh and the phenomenon of &lsquo;Gond painting&rsquo;.</li>\n\t<li>performing identities of &lsquo;artist &lsquo;and &lsquo;craftsperson&rsquo; in the lives and practice of modernist sculptor Meera Mukherjee and&nbsp;&nbsp;Jaidev Baghel, metal sculptor from Bastar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>the role of key museums and institutions in the &lsquo;discovery&rsquo; of art forms and&nbsp;&nbsp;the creation of&nbsp;&nbsp;exhibition paradigms.(Bharat Bhavan, Crafts Museum, Tribal Museum)&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>the role of interlocutors from art worlds, such as J.&nbsp;&nbsp;Swaminathan, Bhasakar Kulkarni , Pupul Jaykar etc and their impact in transforming practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>seeking the indigenous in the &lsquo;folk .</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>this course will enable students to&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>trace&nbsp;&nbsp;shifts in art practices of marginalised constituencies in post- independence India.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>debate the binaries of &lsquo;art&rsquo; and &lsquo;craft &lsquo; as categories created within different social and institutional contexts.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>debate the nature&nbsp;&nbsp;and extent of agency&nbsp;&nbsp;exercised by creative persons from marginalised communities.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>re imagine modes for alternative interventions in art practice.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Themes outlined in the readings below will inform discussions on the modules listed above.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Central India: mapping the field&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Gregory, Christopher A. &quot;Chhattisgarh: At the crossroads.&quot;&nbsp;The Modern Anthropology of India.

While photographic images&nbsp;stand&nbsp;for&nbsp;real/truth of an image, ie,&nbsp;&#39;this exists&#39; in a moment in time, it is also a framing device; it is an apparatus that lends itself to&nbsp;re-presentation and reproduction of an image.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While a still image captures the fleeting momentary aspect of a world we live in, it represents this moment in specific ways. It reproduces this moment, frames it and imbues it with the subjectivity of the photographer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is this aspect of photography that this assignment explores, especially in relation to early photographic folios, albums and other incunabula as Walter Benjamin points out to us.</p>\n\n<p>Note:&nbsp; Sequentiality and Repetition could be utilised to hold certain directorial vision or poetic aspects to the narrative. Also you could utilise&nbsp;the inherent qualities of a photograph- that a photograph&nbsp;manages to capture&nbsp;a fleeting moment of a second (shutter speeds), as well as varying qualities of light (aperture);&nbsp;&nbsp;it captures certain frames that human eye cannot capture, including a point of view where human eye may not be able to reach.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Module 3: Photography and Identities:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This module will address the complex lines of the real and the fictional in relation to photographic images. The two readings will address the forms and formations of identity and the political nature of representation, distribution and circulation of photographic images.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The module will emphasise on aspects of photography that spill into the amateur, the cinematic, and the everyday. Its ubiquitous aspects will be explored through various lenses.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The practice exercise will be a way for students to address the complex space of creating meanings and identities through photographs.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tableaux Vivant and Photography. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Photography and Anthropology,</p>\n\n<p>Archival Practices and Photography.</p>\n\n<p>Artists References:</p>\n\n<p>Hippolyte Bayard,&nbsp; Marcel Duchamp, Homai Vyarawalla, Helmut Newton, N.

Chinese characters are frequently cited as the oldest continuous written tradition, beginning over three thousand years ago, but in that time the physical form of the characters and the materials they were written on have transformed over and over again. We will consider what questions these problems raise for historians&#39; use of textual sources by looking at writing as a social, material, and political act. What were the symbolic meanings attributed to writings that most people could not understand? What practical uses could writing serve? How did access to writing intersect with other social hierarchies, like gender and class? Beginning with the invention of writing in the Yellow River region, we will discuss problems such as: the relationship between speech and writing; changes in writing materials; writing for display and writing for use; censorship; Chinese characters in non-Chinese societies; and debates over script reform.</p>\n\n<p>The written assessment for this class will build towards a final research paper on a topic of the students&#39; choice.</p>\n</div></div>"

The two disciplines continue to enrich and enhance each other such that there are many common publication platforms, partnerships among scholars, and common faculty across departments.

Media outlets refuse to treat marginalised genders as equal participants in the nation and its politics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Many news organisations believe that they are pulling their weight because they publish a few pieces that cater to gender &ndash; the odd inspirational business story, something about reproductive health, the occasional report of domestic or sexual assault, harassment, violence, government schemes or aid for the trans community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So, how can we begin to fix this problem? The answer is that we can apply something known as a gender lens. A gender lens is not a tangible object; it is a way of looking at things, a means to critically assess a wide range of social and political situations, to see how gender-inclusive or gender-sensitive they are.</p>\n\n<p>It highlights the difference in interests for various genders&ndash; within the same household, state, country, or globally &ndash; and also shows how they interact.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Simply put, it is like a pair of spectacles that correct the prevailing view of marginalised genders and their place in the world.</p>\n\n<p>In this course, you will learn how across the global media, gender stereotypes are used to trivialise, objectify and sexualise. With the application of the gender lens, you will be provided with a viewfinder that filters all of that out and exposes the roots of inequality. It will help the students place the spotlight on the realities, needs and perceptions of all genders.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>With a few exceptions &#39;gender issues&#39; are always seen as exclusive of the wider world of economics, politics, sport and current affairs.&nbsp;This class will study reportage on women, men, and LGBTQI issues from an intersectional perspective, as tempered by race, ethnicity, nationality, caste and class &ndash; as well as other factors such as religion, culture and ideology.&nbsp;Through, news&nbsp;reports, films, exercises, field trips, seminars, and discussions, the students will learn how to cover essential stories &ndash; be they of war, poverty, or crime &ndash; objectively and responsibly, by looking for the intersections of gender and these &ldquo;bigger&rdquo; issues.&nbsp;The students will be taught how to use these intersections to write ground reports, narrative pieces and profiles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Two field trips are included in this course</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Prerequisite:&nbsp; Student should have done either the Media Studies Course - Introduction to Newswriting and Reporting</p>\n\n<p>OR&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Any other Gender based course (offered by any department at Ashoka, in any of the semesters before this Spring semester.

Ranging from wall paintings; frames of other works of art; as well as prestige objects displayed in interior spaces, decorative art, is intended to elicit a range of emotional responses including facilitating attachment and inducing awe or pleasure. An important analytical approach to the decorative thus involves the study of affect and agency. Such an approach takes art analysis beyond semiotics and towards cognition. This course, by exploring the decorative in a variety of socio-historical contexts, seeks to interrogate and complicate the binary between high and decorative art while underlining the different analytical approach required to understand the peculiarities of the decorative. Even as divisions between high and decorative art, or fine and applied arts, exist in art historical analysis, often objects and images themselves cross these boundaries. Many art objects are simultaneously decorative or become decorative objects as their context and use shifts. For instance, when Mughal miniature art, meant to be viewed in albums (muraqqa), is used to decorate the ceiling of an audience room in the Sch&ouml;nbrunn Palace in Vienna in the 18th century its modes of viewing and meaning making change. Similarly, when painters in Madhubani in Bihar start painting ritual art on paper thereby creating portable and marketable objects of display, there is a shift in motifs, content and form.&nbsp;This course will thus situate and explore the category of the decorative, and its agency, in a range of socio-historical contexts.</p>\n\n<p>How do wall paintings decorating houses in Rajasthan facilitate placemaking for a peripatetic merchant community? How was the category of applied arts used to construct the colony during the world exhibitions of the nineteenth century? How do contemporary artists negotiate the art market and the demand for works of art in the heavily curated space of the elite &lsquo;drawing room&rsquo;? How do decorative margins or hashiyas constitute or even subvert the meaning of a Mughal miniature? How do ideas of &lsquo;aesthetics&rsquo; and &lsquo;taste&rsquo; shape the decorative? What is the nature of the resistance that geometrical patterns pose to formal analysis and how does one approach the apotropaic and ritual aspects of the decorative? These are some of the questions that this course seeks to address while engaging with aesthetic theories from a variety of cultural contexts to understand the agency of the decorative from a transcultural perspective.</p>\n\n<p>An important element of this course will involve practical engagement with the decorative through field visits to&nbsp;Lodhi Art District to experience wall murals in the city. Other field visits include a trip to the National Crafts Museum, as well as the studio of a contemporary artist. An extensive exploration of the painted towns of Shekhawati, through the photographic collection of the instructor, will also be part of the course. An innovative assignment will involve students engaging with the decorative in their immediate environment of the campus and the home.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Course Modules:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Ontology of the Decorative:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The course begins with exploring the very nature of the decorative. This involves approaching it through the heuristic lens of cognition and the agency of art, based primarily on works by EH Gombrich (1979) and Alfred Gell (1998). Such an approach shifts the focus away from an interpretation of the semiotics of images and hierarchies of aesthetic appreciation to an analysis of affect, agency and psychological impact of the decorative on the observer. This will be discussed through concepts linked to cognitive anthropology (Severi 2004); agency of art objects (Gell 1998); and corpothetics (Pinney 2004).</p>\n\n<p>There will also be an emphasis on understanding surfaces (Wigley 1995), as well as a brief segue into an exploration of the affective role of colour both from a philosophical and historical context (Taussig 2006; Eaton 2017).</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Decorative in the European Context:</strong></p>\n\n<p>This module will explore the category of the decorative through a range of historical contexts. We will first trace the emergence of the category of the &lsquo;decorative arts&rsquo; or &lsquo;applied arts&rsquo; in the European context. This will involve brief overviews of art movements associated with the ornamental, such as Baroque to Art Nouveau and Art Deco; covering, thus, a time period from the seventeenth century to the early twentieth century. A particular emphasis will be placed on exploring the links between applied arts and industrialization. In the exploration of Art Deco, in particular, interocularity between modes of depiction like cinema and decorative arts will be used to explore the aspect of gender.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Decorative in the Colonial Context:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The focus on applied arts will allow the discussions to segue into an engagement with the arts of the colonies as &lsquo;craft&rsquo;/ applied arts, particularly as linked to world exhibitions that started in the middle of the nineteenth century (The Great Exhibition of 1851). We will also study more indigenous versions of the exhibition format, for instance, the Jaipur Exhibition of 1883, which was also titled &ldquo;The Exhibition of Industrial and Decorative Arts&rdquo;. This will allow for an exploration of the category of the decorative as it emerged in the nineteenth century with its links to setting up of art schools, commodification of the orient and emergence of the category of &lsquo;craft&rsquo;. This will provide an insight into early musealization practices, while exploring the reification of the division between high and decorative art. This module though will not only discuss how the &lsquo;colony&rsquo; was consumed, but the multiple ways in which non-western societies consumed other &lsquo;cultures&rsquo; through the framework of the decorative.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Beyond the Binaries: The Decorative in a Global Context:</strong></p>\n\n<p>This module places an exploration of the decorative in a more global context which would include decorative arts from Japan, Korea and South America. This will shift the binaries of locating historical explorations within the dichotomies of the colony and metropole thus allowing the students a wider perspective into the decorative arts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Social Life of Things: Metamorphosis of Art Objects</strong></p>\n\n<p>After exploring the decorative in a variety of historical contexts, this module will explore the change in meaning of objects and images as they travel from one cultural context to another. &lsquo;Culture&rsquo; here would be approached through a range of spatial and temporal scales between boundaries of nations but also boundaries of the rural and urban. This would thus include mobility of images in instances such as when the pages from Mughal albums (muraqqa) were displayed in the millionenzimmer at the Sch&ouml;nbrunn Palace at Vienna in the eighteenth century. It would also include an exploration of instances when art from a ritual context, for instance the wall art of Madhubani, is transferred to a medium like paper and sold in urban spaces as decorative pieces. The metamorphosis of a range of images and objects, as they turn into commodities, decorative or fine art will be explored.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Intransigent Form of the Decorative? Non-figurative and the geometric in the ornamental:</strong></p>\n\n<p>With a focus on Islamic arts ranging from painted scrolls to architectural elements like muqarnas, this module will explore the formal aspect of the ornamental by focusing on the relationship between non-figurative and the decorative, for instance. This would also include exploring the role of the geometric in ornamentation, and the analytical framework required to approach the non-figurative through art-historical analysis.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Placemaking through the Decorative</strong></p>\n\n<p>As Alfred Gell has highlighted, the decorative is agentive because it facilitates a sense of attachment. Given this premise, this module will explore the nature and role of the decorative particularly in the context of public spaces. This would include an exploration of nineteenth and twentieth century wall paintings decorating buildings in Rajasthan (Shekhawati) as acts of place making by a peripatetic merchant community. This would also include an exploration of public art and graffiti in urban spaces. This module will thus explore the complex links between architecture; decorative art and perception as linked to &lsquo;distracted&rsquo; modes of viewing. Since the onus on this module will be on the &lsquo;affective&rsquo; potential of art, this will be further explored though concepts of reception theory like rasa and bhava.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Decorative Art in Contemporary Art Practices: Ideas of Taste</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this module we will explore the ostensible divide between &lsquo;fine&rsquo; and &lsquo;decorative&rsquo; arts through the various transformations that works of art undergo while negotiating the contemporary art market. The categories of &lsquo;fine&rsquo; and &lsquo;decorative&rsquo; art will be historicised while also being studied through the negotiations that contemporary artists, in the context of South Asia, have to make between demands of the art market, museums, as well as decorative/design pieces for the interiors of a private home, office or public space. The theoretical concepts of taste and aesthetics will guide this study into contemporary art and curatorial practices. An important element would be a visit to the studio space of a practising contemporary artist.</p>\n\n<p><strong>From the Margins: The Subversive Potential of the Decorative:</strong></p>\n\n<p>While an enquiry into the decorative has always been on the margins of art historical research, this module explores how the marginality of the &lsquo;ornamental&rsquo; itself gives it immense subversive potential. This would include an exploration of hashiyas (margins) in illustrated Mughal manuscripts that have the potential to subvert the meaning of the main image as well as the text. This would also be explored through Buddhist relief sculpture, as well as through the &ldquo;rhetoric of the frame&rdquo; in a range of images and art objects. The decorative margins will also be explored from the purview of artistic practices, since often the decorative elements of a work were executed by individuals occupying a space of subalternity, thus becoming particularly compelling as spaces of expression that tend to be overlooked.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Learning Outcomes:</p>\n\n<p>Develop an understanding of visual culture beyond the traditional scope of art historical analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Understand the historical developments which led to the reification of categories such as fine and decorative arts.</p>\n\n<p>Develop analytical skills to engage with objects from a variety of contexts through a transcultural approach while learning about the histories of art in a range of socio-cultural contexts.</p>\n\n<p>Becoming more familiar with inter-disciplinary enquiry by engaging with histories of art, visual culture, cognitive anthropology and sociology of aesthetic hierarchies.</p>\n\n<p>Engagement with lived environments through the lens of cognition and agency of visual elements.</p>\n\n<p>Introduction to contemporary art and curatorial practices.</p>\n\n<p>Practise in writing research pieces on topics of art history and visual culture.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Suggested reading:</p>\n\n<p>Auerbach, Jeffrey A.
