Today genetics is used in all phases of life from food to medicines, new discoveries tend to manipulate genetics not only to diagnose and find better cure for deadly diseases like cancer but also to design smart plants and microbes to enhance the quality and quantity of food and secondary metabolites such as biofuel. Hence a thorough knowledge of genetics is an absolute requirement for biologists to comprehend the complexity of life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, you will learn in detail the&nbsp;structure and function of chromosomes and genes. We will then move on to study the key areas of genetic variation and molecular genetics and focus on model organisms used for genetic studies. Subsequently we will learn more about the molecular mechanisms that underlie the genetic code and details about how it si decoded (transcritpion, translation, regulation of gene expression).&nbsp;This course will provide both basic and advanced understanding of the concepts and tools that are used in molecular genetics and molecular biology.

In this course, we will explore various aspects of microbial genetics, evolution, lifestyle and diversity. Starting with a basic understanding of microbial biology in the first half, we will move on to their interaction with humans in the second half. We will delve into how both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes have served as model organisms furthering human understanding of basic biological processes at the molecular level. By recent estimates, the human body houses roughly the same number of bacterial as human cells. We will explore human-microbial interactions starting with infectious diseases and going on to the microbiome. Under biotechnology, we will look at how microbes are harnessed by humans in the food and medicine industrial sectors. While this is primarily a theory course, there will likely be 2 lab sessions to improve understanding of concepts learnt in class. We will also have a guest lecture by an expert in one of the sub-areas we discuss, and use audio-visual support to better our understanding of the subject.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Understand and explain why we still do not know the full extent of microbial diversity</p>\n\n<p>Note how bacteria, viruses, archaea and fungi are different from each other</p>\n\n<p>Note what technical insights/advances helped humans to identify, grow and observe microbes, and what advances we still need</p>\n\n<p>Explain how bacteria propagate</p>\n\n<p>Explain why viruses differ from most other microbes</p>\n\n<p>Describe any one fundamental biological advance made possible with a microbial model system</p>\n\n<p>Mention the causative agents of at least two infectious diseases along with their mechanism of infection</p>\n\n<p>Explain briefly why resistance to drugs is a major health problem today</p>\n\n<p>Describe at least two industrial processes that rely on microbes</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This is a 2000 level course. UG students in or post their 2nd years as well as ASP students interested in pursuing basic, applied or molecular microbiology and/or biotechnology should plan on taking this course. Masters students who have had no prior exposure to microbiology could also consider taking this course. reading material will consist of textbooks as well as some class hand outs.</p>\n\n<p>Recommended textbooks:</p>\n\n<p>Microbiology by Pelczar, Chan and Krieg (5th edition onwards)</p>\n\n<p>Brock biology of microorganisms, (13th edition onwards)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Standard Ashooka grading scale. Course assessment will be done using grading (absolute or relative based on final class performance), in-class quizzes, assignments and or an exam, and group presentations. This is tentative and can be changed based on the instructor&rsquo;s discretion.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Attendance is strongly encouraged. Peer discussions in class are an important component of the overall learning experience. There will be pre-announced spot quizzes as part of the overall assessment and grading. Those who miss these without a valid excuse given before class starts (eg: a doctor&rsquo;s note) will miss the corresponding mark. The questions will be sourced from concepts taught in the classroom as well as common textbook content. Please note that <strong>late class entries will not be allowed</strong>. If you are more than 10 min late, please do not come in that day. It is distracting both to the instructor and your colleagues in class.</p>\n\n<p>This microbiology elective is designed for a holistic introduction to the fascinating field of microbes and their behaviour. The course is intended for those who want to pursue a future career in the biological sciences, be it in academia, industry, science communication, policy or other related areas. It requires a substantial effort both in terms of thinking and reading from students. Slides may be shared post class but will in no way be sufficient for preparation towards assignments or exams. These are only intended as a broad guide to the instructor and students. Assignments, exams and their deadlines are to be taken seriously. Again, missing one without prior information or with insufficient justification (to be decided case by case at the instructor&rsquo;s discretion) will mean missing the corresponding mark.</p>\n\n<p>Use of phones during lectures is not allowed. Any student whose behaviour disrupts functioning may be asked to leave the classroom.</p>\n\n<p>Academic dishonesty (eg: cheating, plagiarism, fabrication) will not be tolerated.

Its applications are not only limited to all subdisciplines of biology, but also across a range of fields outside biology, from cosmology to town building. Evolutionary computation is a distinguished field now enabling solutions to inherently complex systems.</p>\n\n<p>In this course I plan to lay a firm foundation of evolutionary theory with the help of basic principles of genetics along with the tools of mathematics and computation. This will be followed by connecting those concepts to the essence of modern omics techniques, human health and evolutionary medicine.</p>\n\n<p>This course does not need any pre-requisite, except for 10th standard mathematics. All other necessary concepts will be taught during the course itself. However, an introduction to genetics, 12th-grade Mathematics, a basic knowledge of coding in any programming language and will be helpful (but not essential) for this course.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Strong foundational knowledge of the principles behind evolutionary thinking and experimentation.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>There is no prescribed textbook for this course. Suitable reading materials will be shared after the lectures. Interested students may go through the following books for additional reading.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Rice, S., 2004. Evolutionary theory: mathematical and conceptual foundations.</li>\n\t<li>Freeman, S. and Herron, J.C., 2007. Evolutionary analysis.</li>\n\t<li>Hartl, D.L., Clark, A.G. and Clark, A.G., 1997.

Who will survive? What horrors await us?<br />\n<br />\nThis course offers an alternative history of religion in China by focusing on visions of the end of the world in Chinese Buddhist and Daoist thought and practice. These ideas often developed on the margins of society or in direct opposition to the state. How did these groups conceive of time and space? What experiences did members of these movements have? What did they gain from participation in them? By moving these groups to the center of Chinese history, we may then be able to reconsider how we think about Chinese society and culture. In each unit, we will discuss and analyze historical and ethnographic cases in relation to broader anthropological and sociological theories to see how they may or may not apply.</p>\n\n<p>Unit one overviews ideas about the apocalypse in general and conceptions of time in China and early Buddhism. Unit two covers the early developments in organized Daoism and Chinese Buddhism and their apocalyptic visions. Unit three jumps forward in time to late imperial China to discuss a variety of sectarian religious movements with millenarian beliefs. Finally, unit four considers the modern qigong movement Falun Gong and their conception of salvation.</p>\n</div></div>"

Everything around us is a product of some sort of chemical/biochemical reaction. Fate of any reaction is largely controlled by the some very basic molecular properties that affect the rate and mechanism of interactions leading to formation of the product. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This course offers an introductory level understanding of the various processes which influence the stability and reactivity of intermediates and the end products. Course structure is designed to refresh your chemistry knowledge from your school and to prepare you for your journey towards becoming an expert. It will provide comprehensive account of all the key concepts that you may require to solve the puzzles of chemical bonding and reactions.</p>\n\n<p>The world of chemistry, and especially organic chemistry, looks scary. However, if fundamental rules and some basic principles are understood, most things start becoming obvious events which could be planned and designed to follow the desired reaction pathway. Concept of electronegativity, resonance, conjugation, hybridisation, and aromaticity are key in explaining the number of complexities found organic chemistry.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The first question that one might ask is why atoms form molecules, and once they have come close to each other, what keeps them intact. How strong is the force that keeps them held in a molecule? Why certain molecules are linear, many others have non-planar three-dimensional shapes? What are the factors that decide the path and the fate of any chemical reaction? &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We all know that carbon has tendency to form multiple bonds and that is why it may form very large chain of bonded atoms resulting in production of vast number of different compounds. The number of known organic compounds today is humongous. Generally, compounds are given some names based on their properties or behaviour. Such names reflect no information about its compositions. If there is no unified naming system in in existence, it will be impossible to handle such a huge database of existing compounds. In this course we will practice the international nomenclature system (IUPAC) too and learn naming some of the structurally very complex molecules e.g., cyclic/poly-cyclic systems.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of this course is to make sure that your journey into the realm of organic reactions and all those rules &amp; exceptions is more enjoyable!</p>\n\n<p><u><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Course Contents/Topics:</strong></span></u></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Structure and bonding</strong>: Ionic, Covalent, Coordinate and Hydrogen bonds, The octet rule,&nbsp; Formal charge, Sigma (&sigma;-) and pi (&pi;-) bonds,&nbsp; Hybridisation, , Inductive effects, Hyperconjugation, Mesomeric effects, Steric effect,&nbsp; Acidity and basicity, Acids, Bases &nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Aromaticity</strong>: H&uuml;ckel&rsquo;s rule and characteristics of aromatic compounds benzenoid and non-benzenoid compounds, Alternant and nonalternant hydrocarbons, Annulenes, Anti-aromaticity, Homo-aromaticity and Nomenclature of aromatic compounds.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Nomenclature</strong>:&nbsp; Functional groups, IUPAC Nomenclature of aliphatic organic compounds: Alkanes, Alkenes, Alkynes, Alcohols, Amines, Carboxylic acids, Ethers, Halides, and nitriles.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Stereochemistry</strong>: Representation of stereostructures: Fischer, Newmann, and Sawhorse Projection formulae and their interconversions.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Conformational analysis</strong>: Butane and cyclohexane (mono and disubstituted) and their relative stability and energy diagrams.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Configurational analysis</strong>: Geometrical isomerism: cis&ndash;trans, syn-anti, and E/Z notations with C.I.P rules.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Optical isomerism</strong>: Chirality, Enantiomers, The Cahn&ndash;Ingold&ndash;Prelog (R and S) nomenclature, The D and L nomenclature, Diastereoisomers (or diastereomers), Diastereoisomers,&nbsp; Mesomer Racemic mixture,&nbsp; resolution of racemic mixtures</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In case you want to discuss more about the course structure and learning outcomes, feel free to reach me in AC 03, Office 311.

        "description": "<h4>Programming Language Design and Implementation [CS-1319] [CS-1319-1]</h4><div><strong>Faculty Name </strong><div class='cmsDescp'>Partha Pratim Das [partha.das@ashoka.edu.in] ;</div></div><div><strong>Overview</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Starting 1950&rsquo;s (FORTAN &amp; LISP) innumerable programming languages have been designed, implemented, deployed, and re-engineered. Some are targeted for specific domains while many serve to be &lsquo;general purpose&rsquo; and cross-domain. Yet all of them have one thing in common - the ability to express the computational needs for some real world problem, to act as a bridge between the man and the machine. In this evolution, several paradigms of computing emerged &ndash; functional, procedural, object-oriented, generic (meta programming), logic &ndash; to name the major few. And languages have been functional (LISP), procedural (C), logic (Prolog), or simply multi-paradigm (C++).</p>\n\n<p>Programming Languages are living entities of CS. They are born (designed and implemented), grow in their use, and fade out to others. Hence, long serving languages need regular re-births and / or repurposing (C++98 -&gt; C++11 -&gt; C++14 -&gt; &hellip;). Understandably lot of languages (actually most) die when they stop serving their computing role. And a few are resurrected (like LISP), when we rediscover their worth after decades.</p>\n\n<p>PLDI will introduce you to the dynamics of programming language design in the context of evolving requirements and trade-offs concerning syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and paradigms. You have been developers in languages. PLDI will give you the perspective of being creators of them. For this understanding, you will need to master two aspects in depth.</p>\n\n<p>First, how languages are implemented. How to deal with their syntax, semantics, and pragmatics &ndash; traditionally known as &lsquo;Compilation Techniques&rsquo;. This will cover lexical and syntax analysis, memory management, runtime behaviour of programs, translation to machine code, and optimization. Some background material like fundamentals of automata and formal languages will be covered if you are not already aware of them.</p>\n\n<p>Second, how languages are designed. Design is a complex process involving the understanding of requirements of the target users on one hand and the constraints of the syntax, semantics, and pragmatics that is necessary for its implementation on the other. A good designer like Niklaus Wirth of Pascal, Dennis Ritchie of C, Bjarne Stroustrup of C++, or Guido van Rossum of Python works out a best match between the two. You will be exposed to the parameters a designer has to juggle with including Name scoping and binding; Programming elements &ndash; expressions, control flow, procedures, exception, and concurrency; Data types and abstraction - polymorphism; Type Systems; Computing elements &ndash; iteration, recursion, and calculus; Paradigm choice; and Domain specific languages</p>\n\n<p>In the process, you may hope to pick up a few interesting languages.</p>\n\n<p>The course is practice orieneted. So you will need to write a complete compiler for a tiny language.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><ul>\n\t<li>You will learn to be a designer of your own language and be able to implement it. You will also develop deep understanding for why the programming languges are designed the way they are.</li>\n\t<li>You will learn to implement a complier with end-to-end features using the nanoC language and compare it will gcc.</li>\n\t<li>You will also learn the basic language translation techniques and a few interesting languages from different paradigms.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><ul>\n\t<li>Compilers : Principles, Techniques and Tool, Aho, Lam, Sethi, Ullman, 2nd Edition.

Students will undertake a reading and writing intensive coursework in which readings will be organised around a meditation on &lsquo;<em>the Self</em>&rsquo;, that goes beyond disciplinary constraints and attempts to understand the self as an emergent phenomenon with a relationship to space, time, and media, each of which will be an area of investigation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The first section aims to move away from the universalising language that one encounters in utterances such as &lsquo;the unmarked citizen&rsquo; or &lsquo;the rational individual&rsquo;. The readings in this section aim to help one understand the self as a complex and multidimensional entity, which emerges relationally with others, as a &lsquo;presentation&rsquo;, and narratively as a &lsquo;construct&rsquo;. The second section then looks at how the self is an inherently &lsquo;spatialised&rsquo; entity with readings that speak to the relationship between space and selfhood through cultural concepts such as &lsquo;place-making&rsquo;, and &lsquo;lifeworlds&rsquo;. In this, we will also be interested in exploring the ways in which such spatialised, cultural expressions of selfhood get articulated through an engagement with and in various forms of media, especially internet mediated social-media that pervades our ordinary lifeworlds.&nbsp;The course provides space in which you can engage with a variety of source materials and understand how to ask questions that extend and enrich your understanding -- of situations, texts, institutions and people. It is also intended to be an induction into the distinct practices of academic research and writing within a university.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><u><strong>Reading:</strong></u></p>\n\n<p>1.

The final exam is a 100 marks, 2.5 hours assessment on the entire syllabus. Students should exhibit expertise in initial topics and in-depth knowledge of the latter ones discussed in the course. Class probes are monthly problem-solving sessions (about 3 in a semester). These sessions would give students an opportunity to apply recently learnt concepts to new problems and expose them to more interesting ones in a limited time frame. The take-homes are fortnightly problem sets to be solved at home (about 5 in a semester). Students have to do three group projects, once a month.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>TBD.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>FYI, last year&#39;s policy is attached.

Setting up the exercise in decision-theoretic terms has the advantage of disciplining us to make our claims in terms of observable behavior. The course will begin by laying out the substantive content of rationality in neo-classical economics, along with an appreciation of the &ldquo;genealogy&rdquo; of this concept. This discussion will also focus on the Bayesian paradigm and the foundations of subjective probabilities that are fundamental organizing principles when discussing rationality in uncertain environments. Our thorough engagement with decision-making under risk and uncertainty, including the hugely influential expected utility theory, will allow you to understand better the central role that the principle of consequentialism plays in decision-theoretic reasoning. After that, we will look at some leading criticisms of classical decision theory. We will focus on a set of topics proposed as responses to some of these criticisms. Right through the course, we will focus on applications of these insights and ideas in economics and other fields like finance and politics.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Please see attached</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Please see attached</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Please see attached</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Please see attached</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/9cceb1a4-a998-403e-8bd1-4332d69029c8.pdf' download='Syllabus-ECO3105.pdf'>Syllabus-ECO3105.pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>"

We will focus on a set of topics that will respond to rational choice theory&rsquo;s descriptive (and at times normative) limitations. Amongst them will be prospect theory and the theme of reference-dependent preferences; sequential choice procedures featuring multiple rationales; choice theories featuring limited consideration; theories of temptation and self-control. We will also focus on stochastic choices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For the second topic, we will examine the foundations of subjective probabilities and Bayesianism. We will study the classic approaches of De Finetti, Savage, and Anscombe-Aumann to this question. After that, we will focus on the large and impressive literature on decision-making under ambiguity that has emerged in the last three decades or so. Ambiguity, here, refers to decision settings in which a decision-maker perceives &ldquo;uncertainty about probability, created by missing information that is relevant and could be known&rdquo; (Frisch and Baron, 1988). That such decision settings exist was pointed out by Ells- berg (1961). His work showed how ambiguity represents a normative criticism of the subjective expected utility framework of Savage (1954) and, by extension, of the Bayesian paradigm. David Schmeidler&rsquo;s work in the late 1980s revived interest in this area of research. We will cover important models like Schmeidler&rsquo;s Choquet expected utility, Gilboa and Schmeidler&rsquo;s maximin expected utility, Klibanoff, Marinacci, and Mukerji&rsquo;s smooth ambiguity model,&nbsp;and Siniscalchi&rsquo;s vector expected utility. Before getting to all this, though, we will first look at a few landmark models of decision-making under risk like vNM expected utility and rank-dependent utility.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Please see attached</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Please see attached</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Please see attached</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Please see attached</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/61f59b2d-2f47-4441-9721-5e11c9c55edb.pdf' download='Syllabus-ECO6105.pdf'>Syllabus-ECO6105.pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>"

The second half of the course focuses on three key empirical techniques for causal identification: namely differences-in-difference, regression discontinuity designs, matching and instrumental variables. The course will focus mainly on the intuition behind causal identification and applying them in practice. A critical component of the course would be reading empirical academic papers.

Can a writer accurately and<br />\nfaithfully put forth their ideas of their culture and ways of being, which have been shaped by the<br />\ncolonial enterprise? What are the similarities and differences between writers that come under<br />\nthe rubric of postcolonial literature? While Emily Apter argues about the untranslatable nature of<br />\nliteratures from the non-West into a language that is accessible to the West, Graham Huggan<br />\nsuggests that contemporary postcolonial literature is specifically marketed for what he calls an<br />\n&lsquo;alterity industry&rsquo;. In between these two kinds of readings, the untranslatability thesis and the<br />\nmarket-oriented world of publishing, the course will endeavour to engage with issues of race,<br />\ngender, identity, and exploitation that works of postcolonial literature attempt to highlight. The<br />\ncourse aims first to survey the early works of postcolonial studies, including Edward Said, Frantz<br />\nFanon, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, and Ashish Nandy and move to more recent theories of<br />\nRobert Young, Graham Huggan, Vivek Chibber, and others. These will be read in consonance<br />\nwith the works of postcolonial writers, including but not limited to Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&rsquo;o, Chinua<br />\nAchebe, V.S. Naipaul, Derek Walcott, J.M. Coetzee, Arundhati Roy, and others.</p>\n\n<p>2000-level Elective-The Progressive Writers&rsquo; Movement: Fuzail Asar Siddiqi<br />\nThe Progressive Writers&rsquo; Movement, one of the largest literary movements in South Asia,<br />\nattempted to shed light on inequality, injustice, and exploitation widespread in South Asia from<br />\nthe early 1930s to the middle of the 1950s through their literature. They aimed to create a just<br />\nand fair society by highlighting the ills prevalent in contemporary life. This course will aim to<br />\nstudy the works of the Progressive Writers and focus on how their writing endeavoured to think<br />\nof the task of literature as oriented towards social reform and not merely for aesthetic purposes.<br />\nCan literature be only about aesthetics and not about the social? Or are the social and the<br />\naesthetic inexorably intertwined in literature? Is literature supposed to have a socially useful<br />\nfunction? Moreover, who or what is qualified to be the subject of literature, and are there any<br />\nrequirements to be an author? This course will think about such questions by focusing on novels,<br />\nshort stories, and poetry of some of the exponents of the Progressive Writers&rsquo; Movement,</p>\n\n<p>including but not limited to Saadat Hasan Manto, Ismat Chughtai, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Kaifi Azmi,<br />\nSajjad Zaheer, Rashid Jahan, and Ahmed Ali.</p>\n</div></div>"

This includes thinking about the nature of anticolonial struggle and nationalism, the so-called &quot;moment&quot; of decolonisation and the formation of a sovereign state, the relationship between settlers and &quot;indigenous&quot; inhabitants in the ex-colony, and the relationship between the colonial enterprise and the natural environment in the colony. Our discussions will primarily be about the postcolonial novel from three different &quot;postcolonial&quot; contexts of India, South Africa, and Canada. We will thus engage closely with Mahasweta Devi&#39;s&nbsp;Mother of 1084&nbsp;(1974), J.M. Coetzee&#39;s&nbsp;Disgrace&nbsp;(1999), and Margaret Atwood&#39;s&nbsp;Surfacing&nbsp;(1972). Our reading of these three novels will be supplemented with discussion about related critical work by the likes of Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Edward Said, Homi K. Bhabha, Derek Attridge, David Attwell, and Sara Ahmed.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

How might we situate our scholarship in dialogue with such places and with their cultural and intellectual histories? How can thinking about the specificities of place deepen our theoretical generalizations? And how does postcolonial studies itself change if we think from the perspective of islands and archipelagoes rather than subcontinents and continents?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We will address these questions by exploring the environmental imaginations of Caribbean literature as it responds to the inextricably linked (post)colonial histories of extractivist, environmental, and epistemic violence. Caribbean writers have found extraordinarily inventive and wide-ranging ways to navigate both archival erasures and dominant representations of the Caribbean as a picturesque paradise or as place of tragedy or disaster.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will study their environmental manuevres across several different genres and forms&ndash;&ndash;from realism to speculative fiction to epic to satire, from theater to literary essays to allegory to &ldquo;small&rdquo; forms such as the vignette, the fragment, patwa proverbs and creole voicings, short ekphrastic poems, and postcards. We will explore the affordances of each genre for framing and resolving environmental considerations: What vocabularies for environmental witnessing and repair do particular genres offer?&nbsp;&nbsp;How do they approach problems of representation, knowledge, agency, and political desire? For example, how might the politics of water be treated differently in a realist novel, a found poem drawn from a newspaper article, a postcard, and a visual poem?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Our readings will focus on the Anglophone Caribbean, Puerto Rico, Haiti, the Atlantic, and the Caribbean diaspora.

Our theoretical interlocutors include Michel-Rolph Truillot, Rob Nixon, Isabel Hofmeyr, Elizabeth deLoughrey, Yarimar Bonilla, Deborah Thomas, Veena Das, Saidiya Hartmann, and Christina Sharpe. Assignments will include a presentation; exploratory, academic, and public writing; and short writing exercises in different genres.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div>"

This course is interested in navigating the terrain of affect and partition through discussions on language, space, geographies by focusing almost entirely on cinema. This provides the course focus on both the historical backdrop in the background, as well as the slow-moving processes of memory and lexicon-making that partition has affected.

How does service excellence help to achieve this goal? What are the challenges and necessary tools to scale up an existing business/institution without compromising on the aim, values or quality? How to build customer focused businesses while also creating an employee first culture? Will the proposed strategy to scale up bring about a tremendous amount of efficiency or growth, without walking away from what is fundamental to the business? How to intertwine an organization&rsquo;s internal values and external brand elements? What are some of the entrepreneurial principles that can be used in scaling up institutions and how that can be differentiated from conventional methods of scaling up? How to create a home grown brand that is widely recognized and becomes the industry standard? How can learnings from one industry such as airlines be used in a principally different sector? This course aims to teach you how to pursue excellence in organizations, communities and for an individual.

It aims to teach through experience and expects that students will be able to conduct their own mini-projects by the end of the course. Students should be able to make beautiful maps on everything from resettlement following a dam construction to changing political choices in different parts of the world. Students should also be able to answer questions through their own analyses on: where to place windmills, whether deforestation has occurred in a given area and why, map flood risk and damages, glacial retreat and basically most topics in&nbsp;environmental studies.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Students will be graded on 4 metrics:</p>\n\n<p>Class attendance&nbsp;and participation: 15% of grade</p>\n\n<p>Leading discussion (15% of grade): There are 10 readings in this class which will be uploaded on LMS as &ldquo;Reading_Week2&rdquo;, &ldquo;Reading_Week3&rdquo;, etc. Please sign up in the first class for the one you want to lead a discussion on.

Young students are expected to study this history because the idea of Indian Civilization is fundamentally entwined with the Indians&rsquo; sense of nationhood. As if, to be a good citizen and a patriot one needs to be familiar with one&rsquo;s civilizational history. But this&nbsp; further raises the question: What meaning does it hold for a young citizen to belong to a country - a young republic - with claims to an ancient civilization? This course is an invitation for you to explore this question. It requires you to imagine yourself as a flaneur - a person who leisurely strolls, pauses and observes the world around them. Starting our journey at the Ganga ghats to observe the immersion of Gandhi&rsquo;s ashes, we will enter the refugee colonies and detention camps to have conversations with women and children living there, make our way through the new borders with your passport and ration cards, encounter sex workers holding up the constitution asking for their rights, watch the farmers and village folks flicker on the TV screen as we purchase new luxuries in the multilingual city bazaar, and listen to the radio belting out Lata Mangeshkar songs as we make our way across India&rsquo;s post-colonial history. Along the way we will see films, documentaries, posters, advertisements, theater, art, literature, cartoons and encounter peoples and voices that will introduce us to new ways of understanding what it means to be an Indian citizen or a young person living in India today.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Course Requirements</p>\n\n<p>I.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Attendance for lectures: 15%</strong> - Attendance is mandatory.

There are more people in our country than in any other in the world. At a very basic level this demonstrates an ability to stay alive and multiply. In other words, to understand and care for human bodies. There are, therefore, few better vantage points than our understandings of human bodies and health through which to explore the contours, characteristics, and even the plausibility of an &lsquo;Indian civilization&rsquo;. Have there been particular civilizational ways to think about human bodily health? If so, what are these and how best to understand them? These are the main questions we will explore in this course.</p>\n\n<p>To answer the questions, we will delve into over two millennia of medical ideas and practices in region. We will learn about the classical Sanskrit works of Caraka and Susruta, the Persianate canon of Ibn Sina, the birth of modern pandemics during the British Raj, heart transplants in postcolonial India and, finally, the profits and privations around the patenting of medicinal herbs like neem.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the course, students will acquire a broad sense of both Indian history in general and, more specifically, the history of medicine. They will further acquire critical tools for thinking about the role of specialized technical knowledge within society. Additionally, the course will also hone critical thinking and writing skills.</p>\n</div></div>"

It commences with the ideas of Adam Smith, moves on to those of the other members of the Classical School, namely Malthus and Ricardo, and ends the first section of the course with the writings of Marx. Significantly, their work continues to be extensively resorted to even today. Next, before journeying on to the ideas of the great economists of the twentieth century - notably, Marshall, Hayek, Keynes and Schumpeter &ndash; the course engages with&nbsp;the transition in the mode of inquiry to &lsquo;neo-Classical&rsquo; economics, which has come to stay as the dominant pedagogical tool. The&nbsp;consequences of this transition will be highlighted. Neo-classical economics presents economic agents in isolation as opposed to viewing the economy as a whole, the defining feature of the Classical economists and Karl Marx. Now there is no longer a normative concern with the distribution of income or a recognition of its role in driving the economy. Finally, we study the rise after the Second World War of development economics, when the object of attention shifted to the economic problems of Africa, Asia and Latin America, requiring, it was argued, a different treatment than that found in mainstream economics. In this section, the course engages in particular with the ideas of Amartya Sen who opened up a new view of economic development, which can be creatively applied to an evaluation of India&rsquo;s progress since 1947. The course concludes with an introduction to ecological&nbsp;economics, drawing out the implications of the economy being an&nbsp;entity embedded in nature.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The following two books&nbsp;form the main reading material for the lectures: &lsquo;The Worldly Philosophers&rsquo; by Robert Heilbroner and &#39;Great Economic Thinkers&#39; by Jonathan Conlin (ed.) Supplementary reading will be made available when necessary. In the Discussion Sessions&nbsp;students read original passages from the work of Smith, Marx, Keynes and Sen among other thinkers on economics. A contemporary account of the evolution of economics is found in&nbsp;&#39;The Poverty of Political Economy&#39; by Meghnad Desai.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Opting for the course must go with a willingness to read&nbsp;both intensively and extensively.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The course reveals the various modes of reasoning that have been used in economics historically.

The course shall largely focus on the colonial and post-colonial periods in order to highlight to students, not only the reception of concepts like liberalism in the non-European world, but also explore how these concepts underwent changes and reinterpretations in new environments. An often-neglected aspect of the study of politics, is the study of the role of religion in the social and political formations of the non-European world and part of the aim of this course will be to highlight the continuing importance of religious thought to understanding wider political discourse. This course will equip students with a perspective that will enhance and broaden their understanding of notions like the state, liberalism and, democracy beyond their &lsquo;Western&rsquo; interpretations in addition to providing the background for understanding the roots of these concepts in political theory.&nbsp;Most Importantly, the course will introduce students to major non-Western philosophers and thinkers. Apart from this the students will also understand how ideas travel and how these often disrupt the geographical imaginings that we often assume to be unassailable and fixed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The nature of academia has meant that subjects and disciplines have been divided and categorized in what are thought to be distinct conceptual frameworks. However, my own belief is that the most compelling work in the social sciences is predicated on approaches that interrogate and blur these boundaries. Therefore, although this FC is formally linked to the political science department, the material we cover, the debates we unpack and the ideas we explore will also take into account historical context, philosophical underpinnings and indeed aspects of sociological and anthropological work.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

As the situation with media freedom is said to be going from &lsquo;problematic&rsquo; to &lsquo;very bad&rsquo; in several countries of the Global South, where deep inequalities still define their populations, what does it mean for substantive democracy, rather than merely electoral democracy?</p>\n\n<p>In this course, we will examine these questions critically, using such indices as ownership of media entities, their proximity to political parties, the autonomy of other democratic institutions that are expected to ensure the independent and free functioning of the media. We will investigate the challenges posed by a severely constrained media space for sustaining a healthy civil society and fostering a deliberative democracy (one that is &lsquo;talk-centric&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;vote-centric&rsquo;).

On a par with the external world, the inner world of the self is so complicated and multidimensional that can, and indeed should, be studied by diverse branches of philosophy and science. Among other scholars, philosophers have always been tackling puzzlements about the nature of the human self. Some of the fundamental philosophical questions include: what is the nature of the mind and the mental states? What is the relation between mind and body? How can we best understand certain human phenomena like consciousness, intentionality, rationality and personhood? How can we understand and explain mental causation? Are we really free in at least some of our actions? How can we be justified in believing in other minds? &hellip; In this course, we shall explore such problems and examine the main philosophical theories offered as solutions. Though we will occasionally discuss ancient, medieval and modern views, our focus will be on the views of contemporary analytic philosophers. By the end of our intellectual journey, I expect you to get familiar with some of the mysteries of our &ldquo;inner world&rdquo; and become strongly encouraged to enhance your relevant knowledge in future.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

We will read excerpts from the Bible, from the Upanishads, the Pali Cannon, and from foundational texts of Confucianism and Daoism. We will then turn our attention to Plato and Aristotle, reading selections of the Republic and De Anima. Augustine&rsquo;s Confessions will show us how the inner life of Platonism was reformed in the Christian west as a fallen spirit, a model that received its greatest treatment in Dante&rsquo;s Divine Comedy, especially in Purgatory. This view of humanity was eventually challenged in the Renaissance by Pico Della Mirandola in his Oration on the Dignity of Man, and then powerfully by Shakespeare in his 1604 work Hamlet. Of the early modern philosophers, we will read excerpts from Descartes&rsquo; Discourse on Method, Hobbe&rsquo;s description of human psychology in Leviathan, and we&rsquo;ll compare and contrast the views expressed in Hume&rsquo;s Treatise of Human Nature with those of Rousseau in Emile. Kant marks something of a split between the philosophers and the scientists on this question, so we&rsquo;ll touch on his thought before turning to Darwin&rsquo;s early description of human evolution in The Descent of Man, Sartre&rsquo;s radical existentialism of human freedom in Being and Nothingness, and Freud&rsquo;s reworking of Plato&rsquo;s thought. Among the contemporary scientists, there aren&rsquo;t necessarily classics or &ldquo;Great Books&rdquo;, so we&rsquo;ll survey the territory using scholarly articles. The philosopher Chalmers will show us just how far we still have to go in discovering our inner essence in The Hard Problem of Consciousness. Both philosophers and neurologists are exploring the possibility that our inner life is nothing more than an epiphenomenon &ndash; foam tossed up by the waves of the neural structures in our brain, but of no essential or transcendent character. Other scientists are giving us insight into the differences between the inner lives of men and women (in general terms) in works like Why Gender Matters while authors Wilson and Holmstrom spar over whether gender differences are biological or social in nature. Other contemporary thinkers explore the role of culture and language in shaping our inner world and personal identity.<br />\nIf this seems like a lot, it is, because it&rsquo;s a question humans have been grappling with for a long time. &nbsp;The good news it that we&rsquo;ll be working with selections of these works rather than the entire books and all of it will be made available electronically in the course, so there won&rsquo;t be books to buy.

They are the sites of our secure selves and deepest fears. How does literature deal with the institution of the family? What are the filial universes in literature? Does the world of imagination tell us deeper truths about the family - its potential to define and destroy? We will read a range of texts from different cultures, in different genres and also in different languages (through English translations) and ask what might be universal, if any, truths about families. We will examine relationships between kinship, intimacies, sexualities and individual selves. We will dwell upon the community and the individual as a site of contestation, particularly in certain societies. In the process we also hope to gain an understanding of what is literature, what might be its functions and significance. Treat this course as a glimpse into the joy and difficulty of &#39;reading&#39; literature.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>We expect students to learn to engage deeply with a text, and also with their own selves as they do embodied readings, and reflect back upon their own lives.

We shall discuss the history of measurement of time and invention of clocks. Without involving much mathematics, the course will help students derive relationship between speed of light and time, space-time continuum, age of the universe, stars, earth etc. We would then follow concept of time in biology in the context of birth-growth-ageing-death.

It highlights continuities and changes in politics, economy and society by focusing on political structures, class, caste, gender, agrarian relations, urban life and trade. Apart from Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and the advent of Islam, the themes in religious history will include the age-old popular worship of snakes and yakshas and the pervasive influence of bhakti and tantra across religious boundaries. The emergence of regional configurations in politics and the remarkable efflorescence in literary expression, and art and architecture in the early medieval period will be highlighted.

However, how much power did they actually wield? How did they use paintings and architecture to articulate their grand visions of power? What role did war, diplomacy, ideology, and religion play in the process of imperial expansion? These are some of the questions we will engage with. This course offers a comprehensive introduction to Mughal history and historiography. We will explore how the legacy of Chinghiz Khan and Amir Timur Gurgan shaped the empire in South Asia. We will look into the ideals of masculinity that animated Mughal courtly etiquette and study the role of Mughal women in court society. We will investigate how the empire legitimised its rule, disciplined its elite, and created its fabled riches. Finally, we will study why such a huge and prosperous empire fragmented away in the eighteenth century.

How did it acquire this status? Was it one or many? Was it universally accepted or contested? Was it visualized as a guiding principle for rulers, or was it expendable in the ruthless pursuit of power? This course answers such questions by examining the intersection between political ideas and practice in ancient and early medieval India through the prism of texts, inscriptions and visual sources. It explores how ideologies of kingship emerged and evolved over time with special reference to debates about the nature of political power, theories of the origins of the state, the duties of a ruler, the principle of renunciation, and the relationship between kings and the religious domain. It discusses the theory and practice of political violence, with special reference to punishment, war, and the state&rsquo;s interactions with the forest. It also examines attitudes towards rebellion, resistance, and situations when the state became a target of the violence of others. Ancient Indian ideas and debates on the fine dividing line between legitimate force and illegitimate violence, between righteous rule and oppressive tyranny open a window into a comparative study of political ideas and events that is relevant even in our own time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>*** See attached course outline for further details</strong></p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Students will acquire&nbsp;an understanding of the interface between political ideas and practice in ancient India, with special reference to the relationship between kingship and violence.

Simultaneously, the course will examine the interface between&nbsp;&nbsp;humans and other species at different points in the past and thus, explore the associations and connections between history and natural history.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Weeks One and Two</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ways of looking&nbsp;&nbsp;at the jungle and its inhabitants</p>\n\n<p><strong>Weeks Three and Four</strong></p>\n\n<p>Prehistoric peopling and depictions of&nbsp;&nbsp;forests and animals</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding forests and grasslands through science</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animals and humans in rock art</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Week Five and Six</strong></p>\n\n<p>The wild in the world of&nbsp;&nbsp;cities&nbsp;&nbsp;and city dwellers</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Harappan Civilization &ndash; from bones to seals</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Historic India&rsquo;s travellers and their archaeological imprints in the jungle&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Images of forests in ancient art</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week Six</strong></p>\n\n<p>Class Presentations</p>\n\n<p><strong>Weeks Seven and&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Forests in Ancient Indian texts and inscriptions</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahabharata, Jataka tales, Arthashastra, Ashokan edicts and Kalidasa</p>\n\n<p><strong>Weeks Nine and Ten&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jungles and the State in early medieval India</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religious complexes and political centres in central India</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest-dwellers and chiefs in Harshacharita</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week Eleven&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Mughals and&nbsp;&nbsp;wild animals&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week Twelve</strong></p>\n\n<p>Colonialism and forests&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week Thirteen</strong></p>\n\n<p>Class presentations</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>An appreciation of the diverse histories of forests and wilderness &nbsp;in antiquity and beyond is one proposed outcome.

A reconstruction of the crime scene, a search for and evaluation of evidence, serializing events before and after the commission of crime, and coming up with a narrative of how and why a crime was committed are all part of a detective&#39;s workday. A historian&rsquo;s practice of their craft is much the same. The whodunit in our case takes the form of collection and evaluation of several different kinds of evidence that are etched in time &ndash; archival, oral, material, experiential, digital, and psychic. The evidence may speak volumes or may be silent or scattered or fragmented; or it can be absent like Hansel&rsquo;s breadcrumbs that were eaten by the birds; and on some days the Houdini historian even makes evidence appear where people believe there was none. After all, a historian, much like our literary detectives, combines the skills of a huntsman, a conjurer, a forensic scientist, and a ventriloquist. This course takes you on an adventurous journey into the world of history sleuthing where you will learn to hunt for clues, closely read them, and learn to narrativize them.</p>\n\n<p>Special note for Media Studies students: Only 3rd and 4th years&nbsp;can opt of this course</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Learning historian&rsquo;s craft:&nbsp;Historical thinking trains you to question what you know. You will learn to ask: how do I know what I know?&nbsp;How do I piece together the past from evidence that is fragmentary, silent, scattered, or absent? How does working with such evidence challenge the dominant narratives (as presented by the colonial documents)?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Learning How to Narrativize: By learning to formulate a narrative, you will learn to look for sources, understand&nbsp;the relationship between evidence and&nbsp;narration, to establish the connection between evidence and conclusion; and to differentiate between an assertion and an argument.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Learning history through literature: Appreciating that History and Literature are both narrative forms with common origins and that Literature also provides an important doorway for studying our past.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Still working on it.

How did nostalgia shape in Babur&rsquo;s description of his homeland in his memoirs? These are some of the questions this course explores. It looks at various sorts of literary and visual texts - chronicles, biographies, letters, maps, and paintings. Focusing on the early modern period (1500-1800), the course is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on cases drawn from across the world. It unravels the world of Tudor portraits of monarchs, Ottoman maps of the world, letters exchanged between the Mongols and Mamluks, and writings of European explorers in the Americas. The second part zooms in on South Asia. It studies various texts including Mughal autobiographies, Muslim mahakavyas, Jain songs, Sikh chronicles, sufi poetry, Telugu narratives, Gond traditions, and warrior tales. Through this exploration, the course unravels how texts articulated particular notions of identity, how certain textual techniques legitimized authority, how texts expressed certain anxieties, struggles, and ambitions of their authors and patrons, and how textual traditions represented enemies and rivals. We will also understand how different kinds of textual politics resulted from different times and cultures within which they were produced. By the end of the course, students will have a sound idea about the relationship between the politics of textual representation and power in the world that produced our own.</span></p>\n\n<p><u><font face=\"Georgia, serif\">NB: This course is cross-listed with the Department of English as ENG-3220.</font></u></p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;\">By the end of the course, students will have a sound idea about the relationship between the politics of textual representation and power in the world that produced our own.</span></p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><ul>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;\">Class Participation 25%</span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;\">Mid-Term Presentation 35%</span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;\">Term Paper 40%</span></li>\n</ul>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;\">Students can miss upto 5&nbsp;of the 23 classes of this course without having to explain themselves; more unaccounted absences would attract grade cuts.</span></p>\n</div></div>"

Actions in the global context (immigration, economic policy, human rights legislation, and (non)democratic institutions) have a pervasive impact on the lives of individuals and this impact often differs based on how one is situated in the world. This course is designed to explore, analyse and evaluate some of the central issues, values and debates in the contemporary world that have a bearing on normative political inquiry. What relevance do ethical considerations have in international conduct? Is ethical action possible, given the realities of national interests and power politics? Is it utopian to think about ethical factors playing a role in international affairs? And how, in ethical terms, can international acts be evaluated? Nowhere does the uneasy relationship between politics and morality become clearer than in International Relations. Drawing on interdisciplinary perspectives and thematic issues in the fields of international politics, the course will challenge students to reflect on major ethical theories and traditions as well as core problems in the current times. The goal is not to identify correct answers to these difficult questions, but rather to understand the debates involved. The course will engage with the dilemmas encountered in world affairs including: the moral economy of violence, the politics of exclusion, debates on human rights, global justice and cosmopolitanism, ecological responsibility and concerns regarding economic inequalities and unequal development.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>A 100 level course is a pre-requisite for taking this&nbsp;course.</p>\n </div></div>"

There are many reasons to<br />\nstudy this part of the world &ndash; it comprises 5% of the world&rsquo;s GDP, 25% of its people, and<br />\n100% of its dussehri mangoes. However, another great reason (especially for us) is that<br />\nwhat goes on in this part of the world directly shapes us (and we, in turn, shape it). This<br />\ncourse, in particular looks at one important aspect of this story &ndash; the international politics<br />\nof the region.<br />\nMost of us are familiar with the major plotlines &ndash; a former scheming landlord, two<br />\nperennially fighting neighbours, the smaller countries frustrated at this commotion, and<br />\ninterfering outsiders. But, in this course, we not only study the story of South Asia&rsquo;s<br />\ninternational relations, but also try and understand how things came to such a pass,<br />\nwhether they were &lsquo;always&rsquo; the same, and the possible future trajectories. Furthermore, the<br />\ncourse will try to contextualize these findings within a broader theoretical context in order<br />\nto understand how historical structures and relations have shaped the region.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Assessment Criteria:<br />\nClass Participation (Includes Memos (10%) + Thursday Seminars) &ndash; 20%<br />\nTwo pop quizzes &ndash; 20%<br />\nMid-Term Essay (2000 words excluding footnotes/references) &ndash; 20%<br />\nFinal Essay (5000 words excluding footnotes/references) &ndash; 40%<br />\nAssignment Details:<br />\nMemos (after first week): To be submitted by every Tuesday 6pm (late submissions will be<br />\npenalized).

So, the language employed there need not be very<br />\nformal/straitjacketed academic prose. However, the memo should be well argued &ndash; it is not<br />\nan excuse for sloppiness.<br />\nThe essays on the other hand are meant to train you to become producers of knowledge in<br />\nyour own right.

While delving into different case studies from Afghanistan, Vietnam and Ukraine, we will evaluate the potential and limitations of causal explanations of&nbsp; warfare, and their embeddedness within different traditions of strategic thought, including from within Asia, as well as Western Europe. Through these discussions, we will explore the extent to which explanations about war have to be contextualized within global developments of the nineteenth and twentieth century, and how its present day conduct is also shaped by colonial and post-colonial influences. Finally, we will evaluate the role of access to technology, and how decision making structures on military affairs serve as the means to contain or to further proliferate war.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

Foreign policy analysis is granular for it examines how policy-makers decide. As you will learn, actual decision-making is always messier than what grand theories imply. So, from the grand and the &lsquo;macro&rsquo;, we look on the domestic, state, organizational, and personal levels to understand the multitude of factors that affect a country&rsquo;s foreign policy. In order to do this, we make use of various conceptual lenses: theories of rational choice, individual/group psychology, emotions, culture/identity, and political economy. In other words, this course will be an exercise in unlearning IR Theory 101.</p>\n\n<p>So, what are the kind of questions that this class will help you think through? Perhaps questions such as &lsquo;How did Nehru&rsquo;s experience of colonial subjugation shape his ideas of non-alignment?&rsquo;, Why did the US armed forces support the blockade option during the Cuban Missile Crisis?, &nbsp;&lsquo;How does the Pakistan Army&rsquo;s organizational culture affect the country&rsquo;s attitude towards India?&rsquo;, &lsquo;Does the shale-lobby affect Canada&rsquo;s international commitments towards global warming?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Does race impact EU&rsquo;s refugee policy?&rsquo;</p>\n\n<p>Now the brass tacks &ndash; this is a core course and it will have an exam component (see below). In addition, you will also be required to submit one-page (500 words) weekly memos in which you are required to engage with the readings of that week. The tone of these may not be necessarily &lsquo;academic&rsquo; &ndash; it can be conversational, reflective, or humorous. However, you will be expected to analyze, critique, and go beyond the text. What a memo WILL NOT BE is a summary of the readings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Also, an plagiarism (including ChatGPT) will result in an immediete <strong><u>FAIL</u></strong>. No exceptions.</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>Assessment Methods</strong></u></p>\n\n<p>The course includes both continuous and cumulative forms of assessment.</p>\n\n<p>For continuous assessment, the students are required to submit six 500-word memos during the course of the entire semester (as per their choice of weeks). The aim of the memo is to make sure students both read and critically analyze the readings</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, there will be a mid-semester examination in which students will be tested on the fundamentals of foreign policy analysis&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the semester, students will have to write a 2500 word essay, the prompts for which will be provided beforehand. Students will have to choose one of the prompts for the end-semester essay</p>\n\n<p>Participation in the class and the discussion sessions (run by a Teaching fellow) will also constitute a part of the grade.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>Grading Weightage</strong></u></p>\n\n<p>Memos: 20%</p>\n\n<p>Mid Term Exam: 30%</p>\n\n<p>End Semester Essay: 30%</p>\n\n<p>Participation and Attendance: 20%</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Syllabus (Tentative)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 1: What is Foreign Policy Analysis?

Some will aim for schools in the United States. You want to signal that you are serious candidate who can handle academic rigor. Taking this course is a way to signal your competence to those who matter.</p>\n\n<p>Put another way, the admission committee in prestigious universities know how to read between the lines. A strong GPA from a transcript full of fluff courses (lots of movies and fun) means less than you might think. A student who is willing to take more challenging courses even if it affects their GPA sends a different signal to the admissions committee.</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind, What exactly does regime type (democracy/autocracy) has to do with interstate warfare? It turns out there is a body of literature, known as the Democratic Peace (hereafter DP), that focus on such issues. The DP or the absence of wars between democracies, is one of the more significant findings to have emerged within International Relations scholarship in recent decades. It has consequently attracted significant and critical attention of a large body of scholars and policy-makers alike. In this course we will examine the history of the idea, its main empirical claims, the explanations for it, the auxiliary claims and the criticisms of the research. While the methodological slant will be on quantitative research, we will also examine issues of research design as well as historical case studies as appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>This course is level 3000, so a term essay is required. The IR course is cross listed with the PS department. A pre-requisite is a prior level 2000 course at either the PS or IR department.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>1) Since the course is focused on one topic, the DP, students will acquire substantive knowledge about the major issues in DP research. They should be able to highlight the major works and the arguments made therein. 2) Students should be able to provide a reasoned critique of the major works. This is part of the process of learning to reason in a social scientific manner. 3) Students should gain an exposure to some of the quantitative literature on international conflict. 4) Finally, students should be able to judge the validity of the democratic peace and crucially, justify their judgment. 5) When applying the logic of the democratic peace to actual cases, students learn to differentiate actual regime dynamics from superficial bullshit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Most readings are published articles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There are three types of readings.</p>\n\n<p>1.

They say that ``the shortest path between two truths in the real domain passes through the complex domain&#39;&#39;. Theorems and proofs in complex analysis, when you first encounter them, appear to be indistinguishable from magic!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>However, all this only happens when one becomes adept at combining three different skills---analytical skills, algebraic manipulations (of series and products), and geometrical thinking. The goal of the course is to learn some of the basic moves so that you can begin to learn how to make magic yourself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This course is mandatory for Mathematics students. It may be useful for Physics students too as background material and for Computer Science students interested in the analysis of algorithms. That said, we may only be able to cover the theoretical background, and may only hint at some applications.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pre-requisites:</strong> MAT 1000: Calculus, MAT 1001: Linear Algebra, MAT 1004: Multivariate Calculus, MAT 2003: Real Analysis.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Syllabus</strong></p>\n\n<p>The syllabus is as follows.<br />\nThe algebra and geometry of complex numbers, representations of a complex number. Exponential and logarithmic functions. Differentiation, analytic functions, Cauchy-Riemann equations. Contour&nbsp;<br />\nintegrals, Independence of path. Cauchy&rsquo;s Integral Theorem, Cauchy&rsquo;s Integral Formula, Liouville&rsquo;s Theorem and its applications. Complex power series, uniform convergence. Removable and isolated singularities, Taylor&rsquo;s and Laurent&rsquo;s Theorems. The residue theorem and applications.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, we may cover some material involving infinite products, the Gamma function, and elliptic functions.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Texbook(s):</strong><br />\nAt present I am not sure of which book we will follow as a textbook. I like both of the following. Both are very clear. It is possible I will base my lectures from these as well as other sources. &nbsp;<br />\n1. Ian Stewart and David Tall, Complex Analysis, Second ed.\\ Cambridge, 2018 <em>Friendly introduction, with great historical notes. The approach is by extending Real Analysis, so may be easier to learn from here.</em><br />\n2. Bak and Newman, Complex Analysis, UTM, Springer, 2010. <em>Clearly written with complex analysis type arguments.</em></p>\n\n<p>I will suggest problems to try from these, some of which will show up on the assignment.&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The breakup of marks is as follows.</p>\n\n<p>1. Quizzes (10) -- 100<br />\n2. Assignments (5) -- 200<br />\n3. Midterm -- 100<br />\n4. Final -- 100<br />\nAll assignments and exams are currently expected to be take-home.&nbsp; There are no makeup quizzes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While we cannot promise this, roughly speaking 90s will get you A or A-, 80s will be B&#39;s, 70s, C, and 60s D. In general, A&#39;s are perceived by external agencies as excellent, B&#39;s good, C&#39;s average and D&#39;s barely acceptable. Plan to do as well as you can; don&#39;t play the percentage game. Chances of passing the course with less than 60\\% marks are quite low.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>My expectations from you:</strong><br />\n<strong>Lectures:</strong>&nbsp;It is a good idea to attend all the lectures. Review what was done in the previous lecture, and actively try to understand what is happening. And interrupt me. Bring your laptop to class.&nbsp;<br />\nWork on the exercises/problems mentioned in the lectures.&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Quizzes</strong>&nbsp;Quizzes are given during the lectures. You may be asked to do something from the previous class, or even something done within the same lecture. So pay attention, keep up, and come on time. There will be very frequent quizzes with no advance notice.&nbsp; They are an integral part of the teaching methodology.&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Assignments</strong>&nbsp;There will be 5 assignments. Plan to spend&nbsp;<strong> 8--10</strong> <strong>hours &nbsp;each week</strong>&nbsp;on the problems assigned in this course. &nbsp;<br />\nMake sure you try every problem on your own for at-least an hour before giving up. If you give up, you should discuss with your peers, seniors and me, but I suggest you <strong>write the solutions on your own.&nbsp;</strong>I am happy if you work in a group too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>It is expected that each one of you will do <em>ALL</em>&nbsp;the problems in the assignments and exams.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

Such journalistic investigations are not a matter of chance. They are the fruits of rigorous editorial processes designed to support a reporter in the conception of ambitious ideas, nurture their ability to gather evidence through in-depth reportage, and interrogate gaps in the resulting material to produce a compelling narrative. As media organisations across the world navigate the challenges posed by the proliferation of fake news, reducing press freedoms, and the breakneck pace of the online ecosystem, the need to uphold robust editorial practices that strengthen credible stories has increased more than ever before.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In this course, students will immerse themselves into diverse newsroom roles to understand how they influence the evolution of a story. The students will analyse investigations on the same subject by different publications to compare techniques, framing, and efficacy. Through readings, guest lectures (2), classroom discussions and assignments, we will study editorial roles such as that of a: supervising editor, publisher, reporter, fact-checker, copy editor, photo editor, designer, and multimedia producer. The first of the two weekly lectures will include readings and discussions on the specific role, and the second will focus on the break-down and short-term assessment of students&rsquo; understanding of these functions. The students will be asked to read one book (She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story that Helped Ignite a Movement) that will be referenced through the semester. They will also study national and international investigations across mediums, as well as book excerpts, essays, and interviews that illuminate the historical trajectory of different editorial functions.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The course will aim to equip students&nbsp;with an understanding of ideas and practices that include:<br />\n&nbsp;a) Story ideation and pitching<br />\nb) Editorial commissioning and management (including legal protections, physical safety, and mental-health concerns)<br />\nc) Building sources and deploying investigative techniques<br />\nd) Journalistic story structures (learning the way a report is constructed, examining its various sections, and building narrative chronology)<br />\ne) Visual editing<br />\nf) Different kinds of editorial interventions in journalistic stories<br />\ng) Fact-checking and proofing<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Prerequisite terms &amp; conditions:</p>\n\n<p>This is an advanced Journalism course.

Sāṃkhya, perhaps the most ancient philosophical system, formulated a radical metaphysical dualism between the objective and the subjective elements of reality, developed sophisticated epistemology and a unique theory of &ldquo;natural&rdquo; liberation from suffering and the cycle of rebirth. Yoga philosophers, such as Pata&ntilde;jali, Vedavyāsa, Vācaspati Miśra, and others, accepted the major aspects of Sāṃkhya ontology but also developed an elaborate philosophy of mind and theory of meditation. Advaita Vedānta, the most famous and popular philosophical tradition in India even today, rejected the metaphysical dualism of the other two schools in favour of metaphysical non-dualism, according to which only consciousness &ndash; undivided and eternal &ndash; is ultimately real, whereas the world as we know it is merely an illusion. During the course, the students will read the original texts of Sāṃkhya, Yoga, and Advaita in English translations, will engage with philosophical arguments, and assess the relevance and cogency of the ideas of classical Indian systems in the light of contemporary ways of being and thinking.</p>\n</div></div>"

We will use its logic to demonstrate how democracies can have policy outcomes that are systemically distinct from their autocratic counterparts. Next, we will explore the economic and cultural determinants of democracy and study how transitions to democracy can occur. In third part of the course, we will emphasize institutional variations within democracies and identify their consequences. For the last part the course, we will re-examine the policy consequences of regime type.

As India celebrates the 75th year of its independence, what are the successes and failures of the Indian state? Why do the successes and failures seem paradoxical when juxtaposed next to each other? Have rapid technological advancements fundamentally altered how the Indian state works? What are possible ways in which the state functioning can be strengthened? The course will rely on a comparative perspective to examine these questions. Throughout the semester, we will explore various dimensions of the Indian state while also comparing India&rsquo;s performance with other countries such as USA, China, Brazil, and Nigeria.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The course is broadly divided into two parts &ndash; the first part (first five weeks) will introduce students to the major theoretical frameworks used to understand the functioning of the state. We will begin by looking at a range of dominant theoretical paradigms like the principal-agent framework and the state-society framework to understand how politicians or social groups influence the functioning of the state apparatus. The second part will delve into empirical papers and exploration of quantitative metrics on state performance. The theoretical frameworks discussed in the first part will keep reappearing as the course shifts to specific case studies, empirical papers, and analysis of publicly available datasets.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the second part of the course, students will read more empirically oriented papers that explore different facets of the workings of the state. The students will also look at national, cross- national, and sub-national datasets 1 &nbsp;to test out the theories. Each week will touch upon a specific area of state functioning like regulating urbanization, providing basic education, delivery of welfare services, etc.&nbsp;The course will involve multiple group projects as well as an individually written final research paper.</p>\n</div></div>"

In order to understand the complexity of the socio-political discourse that was developing under conditions of colonial modernity during this time (roughly between 1857 &ndash; 1947), students will be introduced to seminal writings of major thinkers and leaders of South Asia who influenced the socio-political struggles in the subcontinent on issues such as nation formation, religious reform, the caste system, the role and place of &lsquo;tradition&rsquo; and &lsquo;modernity&rsquo; on questions such as women&rsquo;s empowerment etc. We will focus on key primary texts, including autobiographies, speeches, dialogues, treatises, letters, ethnography, and literary fiction. We will also read relevant secondary texts to supplement the primary readings for a better understanding of the historical context as well as to gain an understanding of the discursive environment within which these debates are discussed in contemporary scholarly works.

This is because the practices enabled by the institutions of democracy are themselves premised upon an understanding of democracy&mdash;what it is, and what it ought to be. Over the course of its two hundred and fifty years long history, modern representative democracy has been understood in different ways by its admirers and critics. These different interpretations of democracy, which in many ways are at odds with each other, do not fit together into a unitary theory of democracy, but constitute a complex, internally differentiated, body of thought. This course offers an introduction to the various strands of this polyphonic tradition of modern democratic thought.</p>\n\n<p>It is divided into three unequal parts. In the first part, we shall read some of the foundational texts of modern representative democracy from the 18th and 19th centuries. This is followed by a second part, in which we shall consider the debate between Carl Schmitt and his contemporary critics, a debate which constitutes the immediate intellectual context of democratic thought in the post WWII era. The latter is the focus of the third and final part of the course, which is devoted to a brief survey of present-day democratic theory. Here we shall begin with the standard procedural or minimalist theory of democracy, then study the deliberative interpretation and its epistemic version, and finally focus on the populist strand of democratic theory.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The overall aim of this course is to furnish students of political theory and more generally political science some basic theoretical tools for analyzing and understanding the degradation of democratic practice currently underway in India and elsewhere.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>(Tentative)</p>\n\n<p>Class participation (40%)</p>\n\n<p>Three short essays (20% each)</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Students are expected to attend classes&nbsp;regularly.

It is the rhythm that undergirds the verse or the lyric &ndash; subtle, yet strongly present. The South Asian languages have a rich repertoire of such metrical templates, and these are used with telling effect in poetry. There is even a highly sophisticated science dedicated to the study of metrics &ndash; <em>Chandas-śāstra</em>. In this course we will get an introduction to the major metres seen in Sanskrit and Prakrit literature - the syllabic (<em>vṛtta</em>) and the moraic (<em>jāti</em>) types. We will learn the &#39;science&#39;&nbsp;of scanning&nbsp;a verse and identifying its type; we will also learn a bit about the history and development of metrical forms. More importantly though, we will listen to several samples of verses being recited and sung.

The syllabus is designed to familiarize the students with select concepts and ethnographies of the discipline. We will discuss the sociology and anthropology of kinship, social stratification (caste, race, tribe), cities, migration, nationalism, and environment. Rather than treating these as independent concepts, we seek to show their inter-relation with other social phenomena. For example, how are notions of family and kinship intertwined with science and technology studies; what is the connection between migration and urban transformations, how does one critically study the relation between environment and tourism etc. By doing this, the course demonstrates how the sociological approach explores and finds relations and connections between people, places, and objects. The objective of this course is to develop students&rsquo; appreciation of concepts and categories and their evolution and innovation. This course will also demonstrate to students how theory, ethnography and critical thinking can be integrated. Course materials will include examples from India as well as other parts of the world, and will offer a representative overview and not exhaustive coverage of all topics and perspectives existing in the discipline.

We specifically focus on the centrality of visual archives in mapping histories of European colonialism under Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, French, and British empires. The course will address a range of colonial formations and diverse articulations of nationalist thought and consciousness in different parts of the world through different visual forms across a range of media, sites, and objects. Beginning from naturalist paintings and drawings of unknown landscapes and oceans, descriptions of plants and animals, of unknown humans and exotic objects, the course moves on to explore diverse media and technologies of visual (re)productions like water colour, oil painting, lithographs, oleographs, chromolithographs, aquatints, photographs and the moving image, and maps different sites of visual simulations like cabinet de curiosities, &lsquo;freak shows&rsquo;, world exhibitions, metropolitan, colonial, and postcolonial public museums, art galleries, institutes of fine arts, crafts and design pedagogy. The course argues that global histories of colonialism, nationalism, and decolonization can be partially explored as histories of encounters, violent conflicts, tortuous negotiations, and often uneasy accommodations played out at the register of the visual image. The course urges us to rethink that notions of metropolis and colony, empire and nation, colonizer and colonized, alien and indigenous, as they are configured and reconfigured in the archives of the visual image, are historically relative, often fluid categories, having only situational relevance. Moving away from a purely Euro-centric discussion of the beginnings of Art and Art History, this course seeks to move towards a global history of art.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Learning Outcomes<br />\nOn successful completion of the course, we will be able to:<br />\na) Identify and analyze aspects of works of art and visual images in different material and medium using appropriate vocabulary.<br />\nb) Explore the main trends in the development of Art History and Visual Culture by accessing the critical essential skills.<br />\nc) Evaluate the approaches of artists, art historians, visual anthropologists and curators to the field of visual arts.<br />\nd) Develop the interests for a future training in critical art historical training and art curatorial programme.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Pre-requisites: None</p>\n\n<p>Modules and Select Readings</p>\n\n<p>1.

What is specifically South Asian about South Asian Art? What does it mean to think of South Asia and Art as analytical categories? Did South Asian Art always exist? Or were historical processes involved in the making of the field? Where do we locate the &ldquo;genesis&rdquo; of art in South Asia? Did art forms in South Asia emerge in a zone of cultural and social isolation? Or can we trace trajectories of trans-regional contacts, encounters, and exchanges as central to the shaping of the field of South Asian Art? What is space of tradition and innovation in the visual arts of South Asia? Did arts of South Asia &ldquo;influence&rdquo; artistic practices in other regions? How did artists at different points in history think about the region we identify as South Asia? Seeking to address some of these questions, this course examines aspects of the visual arts of South Asia from its earliest traces in cave paintings and stone implements to sculpture, painting, illustrated manuscripts, calligraphy, and architecture. The course follows a chronological scale, from pre-history to c. 1980s. The vast geographical as well as the temporal span of the field will restrict the course from delivering an encyclopedic survey. Instead it will prioritize intensive analysis of selected themes. Rather than placing the teleology of South Asian &ldquo;art&rdquo; solely in the context of changing dynastic histories, the course takes up specific themes in art across a range of objects, artefacts, archaeological sites, built spaces, religious and political symbols, and institutions of art pedagogy and exhibitions. In the process we address the questions of image, icon, and representations of body, landscape, portraiture in the context of social and ideological changes, aesthetic turns, shifting patrons and markets, and introduction of new material media. The course will probe both &lsquo;South Asia&rsquo; and &lsquo;South Asian Art&rsquo; as stable (art) historical categories and map the new methodologies and vocabularies employed by art historians. Class discussions will form the basis for museum and&nbsp;gallery visits to the National Museum of India (New Delhi), NGMA (New Delhi), National Handloom and Handicrafts Museum (New Delhi), and KNMA (New Delhi) which will enable us to study the works of art in their institutional locations and explore the visual dynamics of organization of exhibition spaces.<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>On successful completion of the course, we will be able to:<br />\na) Identify and analyze aspects of works of art and visual images in different material and medium using appropriate vocabulary.<br />\nb) Explore the main trends in the development of Art History and Visual Culture by accessing the critical essential skills.<br />\nc) Evaluate the approaches of artists, art historians, visual anthropologists and curators to the field of visual arts.<br />\nd) Develop the interests for a future training in critical art historical training and art curatorial programme.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Pre-requisites: This course has no pre requisites</p>\n\n<p>Course Modules and Readings</p>\n\n<p>Introduction: Interrogating South Asia: Visualizing a &ldquo;region&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Readings</p>\n\n<p>Mohammad-Arif, Aminah. &ldquo;Introduction.

The assessment and grading criterion are as follows: 1. Students will be assessed on basis on their active engagement with course contents during classes and after class office hours which will carry ten percent (10%) of the total course grades. 2.&nbsp;Museum and gallery visits and image analysis will carry thirty percent (30%) of the total course grades. The subsequent submission of a written report on an object/ image of your choice (within a word limit of 600 to 800 words) counts for 30% of the total course grades. 3. The mid semester assessment will comprise of a class presentation based on any one image chosen by the student in discussion with the instructor. The mid semester evaluation will carry twenty percent (20%) of the total course grades. 4. For the end semester evaluation we will write an essay between 2000 and 2500 words (including footnotes and bibliography). The topic of the end semester assessment has to be chosen by the student from a range of verbal text and visual image prompts provided by the course instructor. The end semester assessments for this course will follow a feed forward method and students are actively encouraged to submit (within date and time specified) one working draft/ draft in progress to the course instructor for comments and feedback. The end semester assessment will carry forty percent (40%) of the total course grades. 5. All submissions including field reports, mid semester and end semester papers have to be made electronically. 6. Plagiarism (intended or unintended) constitutes the most serious academic offence. Any act of plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Integrity Committee of the University and will attract punitive measures from grade cuts to failing the course. The first detection of plagiarism in any paper will result in grade cuts and reporting to the AIC. For repeat offense, students will be allotted a Fail grade for the entire course. Please go through the Academic Integrity document of Ashoka University to check what constitutes plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty. Specific citation styles for texts and images will be addressed by specific course instructors.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Three undocumented absences are permitted for the entire semester.</p>\n</div></div>"

This course will discuss how these biological keys or biomolecules are structured for their specific functions. Through this journey, we will ask some of these questions:</p>\n\n<p><strong>How structure determines function L1-L2</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The architecture of proteins L3-L4</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Methods to determine macromolecular structures L5-L6</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Carbohydrates and Lipids: Biomolecules and their functions L7-L8</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Cell membranes L9</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Viruses: symmetry and structure L10-L11</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Structural biology of Immune system L12</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Macromolecular interactions: making sense of molecular crosstalk L13</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nucleic Acids (Structure-function) (6 lectures)</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>DNA</strong></p>\n\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<li>Different structural forms of DNA, function, and biological importance</li>\n\t<li>Catalytic DNA structure and function</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>RNA</strong></p>\n\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<li>Different types of RNAs and functional roles along with structures</li>\n\t<li>tRNAs, Ribosomal RNAs, RNA-protein complexes</li>\n\t<li>catalytic RNAs and riboswitches</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>How to evolve or select a structure/function?

Students will learn in detail about various evolutionary processes in natural populations, using the key concepts of population genetics, life-history evolution, sexual selection, phylogenetics, experimental evolution and molecular evolution.</p>\n\n<p>Population genetics and Phylogenetics modules will introduce the students to the basics of evolution of natural population; elements of population subdivision (from segregation of social units to differentiation among geographically isolated populations), genetic connectivity, dispersal, and population divergence. The module on phylogenetics will introduce concepts and methods of reconstruction of population histories. Hands on exercises will help the student learn the application of these concepts on publicly available datasets and address pertinent questions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The module on molecular evolution will cover the molecular basis of variation, adaptation and selection. We will discuss how experimental evolution can be carried out in the laboratory, and how genetics, molecular biology and evolution blend in as we look at the evolution of genes and genomes. Real world examples of evolution in action will be discussed. We will also explore how the genetic code itself can evolve and its implications for living systems.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Overall, this course will also strengthen the philosophy of studying Biology where understanding concepts and the ability to synthesize ideas are more important than mere acquisition of mundane information. At the end of the course, students will not only be familiar with the key concepts of evolutionary Processes, but also understand how they can collectively contribute to the development of almost all the other areas of modern biology, including our current research efforts on climate change, antibiotic-drug resistance, host-pathogen interactions and emerging infectious diseases.​​</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Suggested reading:</p>\n\n<p>Principles of population genetics by Hartl and Clark; Tree Thinking</p>\n\n<p>An Introduction to Phylogenetic Biology by David A.

It considers these vital acts &ndash; of reading a text closely, of making connections between different subjects, of participating in an ongoing conversation, of being discerning about source material &ndash; as essential habits that can be strengthened through repetition. The course provides space in which you can engage with a variety of source materials and understand how to ask questions that extend and enrich your understanding -- of situations, texts, institutions and people. It is also intended to be an induction into the distinct practices of academic research and writing within a university.

Our collective endeavour will not be limited to the interpretation of individual poems but will include determining the ways by which satisfactory answers to such a question can be figured out. In the process we will devise methods to reliably identify and study the fundamental constituents of any poem. Two such constituents, for example, are language and mind, and so we will explore ideas in the philosophy of these objects to develop an acceptable answer to our question.</p>\n\n<p>As we progress, you will learn and practice via exercises some elementary techniques from logic, and bring them to bear on basic ideas about the nature and philosophy of art. This [logic, arts] framework will also necessitate a collective exploration of human nature (since explanatory thinking and artistic creation remain distinctly human properties, without discussing human nature questions such as ours remain a mystery).

Our collective endeavour will not be limited to the interpretation of individual poems but will include determining the ways by which satisfactory answers to such a question can be figured out. In the process we will devise methods to reliably identify and study the fundamental constituents of any poem. Two such constituents, for example, are language and mind, and so we will explore ideas in the philosophy of these objects to develop an acceptable answer to our question.</p>\n\n<p>As we progress, you will learn and practice via exercises some elementary techniques from logic, and bring them to bear on basic ideas about the nature and philosophy of art. This [logic, arts] framework will also necessitate a collective exploration of human nature (since explanatory thinking and artistic creation remain distinctly human properties, without discussing human nature questions such as ours remain a mystery). Other stable aspects of the course include lectures on the philosophy of scientific methods and their convergence and distinction from&mdash;and use for&mdash;questions in the arts; group discussions on the interpretation of poems; discussing relevant scholarly essays; identifying, giving analysis and justifications for literary qualities in sentences, among other activities.</p>\n\n<p>You will find that typical academic activities will follow naturally for you to develop an answer.

In this course we will explore the relationship between the literary and the carceral: Why do people write in prison?Why do people write about prison? Why should we read these narratives?&nbsp;These writings have often been valued as counter histories or for the political significance they hold. But what happens when we read these narratives as literature? What does a literary framework do that other disciplines of engagement cannot? How does the literary framework enhance the socio-political importance of these writings but also what are some of the ethical constraints that come with its association with the literary and how does it challenge the limitations of literature itself? We will read some of the prison writings of the twentieth century from across the globe and think through these questions. Some of the writings we will look at are Behrouz Boochani&rsquo;s&nbsp;No Friend but the Mountains,&nbsp;Sinan Antoon&rsquo;s&nbsp;Ijaam, Naguib Mahfouz&rsquo;s&nbsp;Karnak Cafe, Mohamedou Ould Slahi&rsquo;s&nbsp;Guantanamo Diary, Elias Khourey&rsquo;s Yalo, Chester Himes&rsquo;s&nbsp;Cast the First Stone&nbsp;and Varavara Rao&rsquo;s&nbsp;Captive Imagination.</p>\n</div></div>"

We will particularly be looking at how individual and collective deaths connected to India&rsquo;s colonial experience are remembered in the present moment by the erstwhile coloniser. We will be close-reading life-writing by Indian sepoys who participated in the First and Second World Wars, Queen Elizabeth II&#39;s obituaries, and journals published by Raj-nostalgic British associations and visiting colonial cemeteries, museums, and memorials to see how narratives of mourning, martyrdom, and sacrifice support the circulation of ambivalence into colonial discourse.&nbsp;A considerable faction of the world still believes that colonialism was entirely beneficial for the erstwhile colonies&nbsp;even&nbsp;in the present moment of postmemory or countermemory, revisionist histories, oral histories, broadening of the archives, an intermingling of disciplines, and decolonisation of canon and knowledge. The seminar asks how that is possible. How is conscience managed? And how does mourning relate to it?&nbsp;Through the study of the specific context of India&#39;s colonial discourse, the seminar opens ways to think about how&nbsp;ambivalence of death feeds the present political discourse in the world with dangerously communal/racial undertones where wars, terror attacks, and martyrdom are all narrativized in fixed contexts to further specific ideologies.</p>\n</div></div>"

It aims to introduce the student to economic change in the country. It locates&nbsp;the Indian economy within the world economy and dissects&nbsp;how that&nbsp;relationship has evolved over time. As contesting perspectives exist, students are exposed to them all. The course commences with a study of colonial economic policies and the impact they had on India&#39;s economy. In this section students read the work of major historians. The course then moves on to a study of the evolution of India&#39;s economy since 1947, taking the student through the Nehru era, the Indira Gandhi years, the reforms of 1991 and economic performance under the Modi government. In this section the students read the work of leading Indian economists. The topics covered will include the colonialisation of India&#39;s economy, the &#39;de-industrialization&#39; debate, land tenure legislation and its enduring consequences, famines and the Raj, colonial institutions, the origins of modern industry, the Nehru era as a watershed, planning, the Green Revolution, early liberalisation moves, &#39;1991&#39;, the high-growth phase 2003-08, the Modi years and the impact of COVID-19.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>The course is structured&nbsp;as follows. It&nbsp;will start with lectures to be delivered by me. These will be followed by class presentations by the students arranged in groups, with the topics and groups to be formed by them. The major&nbsp;part of a&nbsp;presentation session will be the presentation itself. It will then be commented upon by another group during the session.</em></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Students will receive&nbsp;guidance in the choice of topics for the presentation and the associated reading material.</em></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>The topics for the presentations shall be chosen by the end of the fourth week.

With this, it is expected that by the end of the course, students will be equipped&nbsp;to form a critical judgment of much of the economic history of India.</p>\n\n<p>Discussion will be encouraged in the lectures and is expected at the presentation.

The course starts by developing a simple theory of cities (the monocentric city model)&nbsp;and its implications for density, city size&nbsp;and housing prices. We will study the internal structure of cities by introducing the key notion of spatial equilibrium, and then evaluate the effects of land use policies, different means of transportation and infrastructure and housing policies on land and housing values. We shall also consider spatial equilibrium across a region using the framework of Rosen and Roback.</p>\n\n<p>We shall also briefly consider the empirical literature that seeks to test some of the theories developed. Other topics that will be covered, time permitting,&nbsp;include&nbsp;urban governance, urban growth and decline and more<br role=\"presentation\" />\nlocal aspects such as neighbourhood choice and gentrification.

Lastly the roles of education, healthcare, property rights, birth control, political franchise and representation in mitigating gender-based inequalities will be studied. Students would be able to understand and appreciate both market and non-market factors that result in or promote gender based inequalities.

The aim of this course is to learn: 1) recursive competitive equilibrium models that feature individual&nbsp;heterogeneity, with some coverage of firm level heterogeneity too ; and 2) how to solve numerically for the equilibrium of these economies. These models are helpful to analyze a wide range of questions pertaining to business cycles, income distribution, asset pricing etc. The course will start with a discussion of aggregation with heterogeneous agents. It will then consider the benchmark of complete markets and tests of the same, after which it will lay the foundations for models of incomplete markets, emphasizing the precautionary saving motive. These strands will coalesce in the canonical standard incomplete markets model of Bewley-Aiyagari-Huggett. The last set of lectures shall discuss extensions of the standard incomplete markets model, economies with heterogeneous firms, and conclude with a brief introduction to heterogeneous agent New Keynesian models.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The main goals of this course are to expose students to questions and methods at<br role=\"presentation\" />\nthe research frontier, discuss a variety of open questions in this area that can lead<br role=\"presentation\" />\nto research papers (or a dissertation), and equip students with the tools necessary to<br role=\"presentation\" />\ntackle these questions.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Lecture slides and additional reading materials/references shall be provided on the course website.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Satisfactory completion of the course requires consistent class participation, the completion of problem sets, a referee report and a research proposal (one of which shall be presented at the end of the semester).</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>None</p>\n</div></div>"

In this course we will have the opportunity to read a selection of texts that others in the community of literary scholars have found particularly helpful for thinking through some of the problems that crop up in our studies of literature and culture. We will become acquainted with the intellectual projects of authors whose names circulate frequently (Marx, Freud, Foucault, Butler, et. al.), but those people are by no means the be-all and end-all of theory. Rather, &ldquo;theory&rdquo; is simply a shorthand for a wide-open corpus of material: anything that helps us to speak, think, and write about literary texts and other cultural phenomena&nbsp;could be called theory. As such, what we call theory may go on and on, but the semester does not, so to lend sense and stucture to our investigations we will organize this class around a set of &ldquo;big questions,&rdquo; not the least of which is, &ldquo;what is theory and what is it good for?&rdquo; Instead of pursuing the impossible task of a comprehensive overview of theory, in this class we will work on the practices of reading theory, such as identifying arguments, key concepts, and getting comfortable with the idiomata of theory. Doing so will provide us a basis for further theoretical exploration and pointing us in new directions for our writing.</p>\n</div></div>"

Not much, you might think. On the contrary, quite a lot. Even when they are vastly different from each other in politics, whether left or right-wing, radical or conservative, highly organized or very diffused, they are all examples of social movements.</p>\n\n<p>It is quite likely that you are often asked to tweet, friend, like or donate for some social cause. That is because&nbsp;social movements are propelled by the rhetoric and politics of emotions. It is true that intense emotions like those of anger, fear, disgust, love, empathy or grief are habitually invoked for social mobilizations and persuasion by most populist leaders.&nbsp;To study rhetoric and social movement therefore, is to study how dissent from poor and working-class people, women, people of color, LGBTQ activists, the disabled, immigrants, and other incompatible voices, come together in diverse ways to aid in building justice.</p>\n</div></div>"

This seminar thinks (and feels) about nineteenth-century novels through affect theory. Apart from considering emotions as interior and personal, we will think through the ways in which feelings are material, social, and political, and ask what feelings have to do with gender, class, and sexuality; places and times; bodies and minds. Many theorists of affect explore it as a way of thinking through interconnection and in-betweenness rather than essence; the keywords that emerge include force, intensity, flux, becoming. The Victorian novel, organised around intense sympathies, allows us to trace large forces that register as minute states of feeling, and to think about how genres of literature intersect with approaches to emotion. This is a reading-intensive seminar; we will spend time with theorists including Eve K. Sedgwick, Silvan Tomkins, Brian Massumi, Lauren Berlant, and Sara Ahmed; and literary works by Jane Austen, Walter Pater, Thomas Hardy, George Eliot, and Henry James, among others.</p>\n</div></div>"

This course provides an opportunity to critically assess the stories that shaped our understanding of morals, culture, and values, as well as those we will impart to future generations.

We will write our own children&rsquo;s book to gauge all that we have learnt.</p>\n\n<p>This course aims to examine how the books children read shape their outlook and emotional development. We will study the historical, creative, nurturing, emotional, and educational aspects of these forms of literature and their impact on us later in life. We will also consider why a study of children&rsquo;s literature is important, and how it impacts pedagogies for children across borders.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will examine the views of multiple theoretical thinkers and texts in conjunction with actual children&#39;s literature. We will ask the important but often overlooked questions about this particular genre, mainly focusing on Indian and Western children&rsquo;s literature. The purpose is not so much to compare these two cultural offerings, but to give us a taste of both.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall consider popular stories for children up to 12 years old, including Harry Potter &amp; The Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone, Amar Chitra Katha, Matilda, The Little Prince, Feluda and Mulan. At the same time, we will also study theoretical thinkers such as Jack Zipes, Seth Lerer, Paulo Freire, and Bruno Bettelheim to help us navigate the complex field of children&rsquo;s literature in relation to issues of culture, religion, difference, gender, and sexuality.</p>\n\n<p>We will unpack the didactic intent as well as the pleasure principle that might have prompted the writers. Authorial intent is, however, only one part of our study; the other part is to see how children and parents receive these stories. Children&rsquo;s literature creates moral as well as national frameworks that help acculturate young people. In examining the genre of children&rsquo;s literature, we will consider various sub-genres such as picture books, fairy tales, fables, and chapter books.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>To understand the politics, purpose and utility of chlldren&#39;s Literatiure.</p>\n\n<p>To familiarize ourselves with the theories&nbsp; behind children&#39;s Literature.</p>\n\n<p>To write our own children&#39;s book as a hands on experience.</p>\n\n<p>To learn to critique various children&#39;s stories - including our own.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>For all readings that are written in the syllabus on a particular date: you should have completed your reading before that day&rsquo;s class.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Please note that supplementary readings may be assigned during the course of the semester.

The course assumes no knowledge of marketing, and moves from the basics of defining and capturing value and understanding consumers to key marketing concepts such as segmentation, targeting and positioning, and then culminates in the in-market execution of positioning using a synergistic mix of product development, pricing management, communication and in market execution. The course also looks at brands, brand strategy and brand equity and their impact on consumer value and brand strength. We will look at marketing theory, but with a strong application bias. As we seek to understand how to market products and services, we will reflect on and learn from our experiences as customers and how we are impacted by marketing. TO get the most out of this course, you will be well served by relying on your experiences as a consumer, and for keeping your eyes open and observing other customers as a marketer</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/44c303db-38d4-4112-a719-2dfe4843dfdc.pdf' download='Fundamentals of Marketing - 2023.pdf'>Fundamentals of Marketing - 2023.pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>"

In this course we will try to understand ourselves, the people and animals around us, and all the ways in which our interactions produce learning.&nbsp;We will explore the specific question of how we learn, how we absorb and retain new material, the ways in which our brains tend to conflate correlation and causation, how we make decisions, and what critical thinking means. We will take a look at complex and interesting phenomena such as motivation, emotion, language, consciousness and attention. We will think through inter individual behavioural differences and what kinds of evidence we require to draw conclusions about group behaviour.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Every conversation, every memory, even your reading of this course outline, structurally and functionally changes your brain, but not everything that the brain processes seems to make it to the realm of conscious perception. We will think about various seemingly intangible aspects of the mind and try to imagine how to make sense of them. We will focus on the limitations of what we collectively understand and the ways in which we might imagine advancing our collective knowledge about the mind and behaviour. The goal of the course is to provide you with the tools with which to ask these questions and begin answering them.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Every week of the course comes with specific readings.

The idea behind this is to keep providing conceptual testing to enable you to check the soundness with which you have understood the material. There will be no testing requiring rote learning or simply checking familiarity with information.</p>\n\n<p>Your participation in class will count towards 20% of your grade: 10% is for attendance and 5% for participation in the discussion section; 2% is in terms of class participation (questions in class will be counted, as will engaging on Canvas, by email, if you have any anxieties around participating while class is ongoing) and 3% is your attendance counted as part of your participation grade.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Attendance: will be marked as a component of the participation grade, but not as a barrier to doing exams, etc. Three unexcused absences are permitted. Missing class is a student&rsquo;s loss and will impact the class participation grades. For students who miss class for unavoidable reasons, they can visit the TF, during office hours for help.&nbsp;All those who are unable to attend classes due to medical reasons are requested to email the TAs&nbsp; (and cc&#39;d to the TFs, but please not to Bittu!), with a copy of their medical note or prescription (with the date clearly mentioned) along with their emails, for an excused absence.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

However, the relation between thought, reality and time has always been a matter of debate. The Greek word <em>theoria</em>&nbsp;meant contemplation, the act of looking, which later acquired the sense of an intelligible explanation based on observation and reasoning. <em>Historia </em>meant inquiry, the search for knowledge; and it evolved over time to mean investigations and accounts of past events. <em>Philosophia</em> meant the love of wisdom. These words, which relate to human experience in its deepest sense, prompt my choice of great books. As to why this is so should become clear in due course. &nbsp;The books are:</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;\">Simon Leys; <em>The Hall of Uselessness: Collected Essays</em>, (2011)</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;\">Tibor Szamuely; <em>The Russian Tradition</em>; (1974)</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;\">Margaret Chatterjee; <em>Gandhi and the Challenge of Religious Diversity</em>; (2005)</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;\">Albert Camus; <em>The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt</em>; (1951)</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;\">Mark Lilla; <em>The Reckless Mind: Intellectuals in Politics</em>; (2001)</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;\">Stanley Rosen; <em>Nihilism: A Philosophical Essay</em> (1969)</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;\">The first three books deal (in part) with history; with what is called tradition; and the treatment of these themes in political writing and fiction. The latter three deal with philosophical issues directly. I will introduce students to these books and specify certain chapters for required reading. Their scholarship will educate us and prompt us toward further study. Some will illuminate important historical events; others will raise issues common to human experience regardless of time and place.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;\">Dilip Simeon, PhD</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;\">Visting Professor, Ashoka University</span></p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;\">Aside from the specified books; an extended PDF archive of related books and articles (along with a summary of major events following the French Revolution of 1789)&nbsp;will be available to you for consultation;&nbsp;to&nbsp;which your professor and the teaching fellows might refer.</span></p>\n\n<p><font face=\"Georgia, serif\">NB: This is a dense course of study and I advise you to opt for it if you are prepared to work hard.

This work set the pattern for historiography &ndash; and fictional narratives &ndash;&nbsp;in the classical Chinese language, a narrative form which contrasts in many ways with the norms of modern history writing. At the same time, Sima Qian dealt with many of the same questions that perplex modern historians: how do we explain causation among seemingly unrelated events? How do the circumstances of the historian&rsquo;s life shape their writing? How do we understand gaps in our sources? In this class, we will reflect both on traditional Chinese historical practice and on our own. In the first part of the class, we will discuss the world into which Sima Qian was born and the kinds of historical writing that were current before his transformative work. In the second part, we will read excerpts from the Records of the Grand Historian. In the third part, we will investigate his influence on Chinese historical writing in both its official and unofficial forms. Finally, we will experiment with writing in Sima Qian&rsquo;s narrative style ourselves.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Preparation for class and in-class participation: 30%</p>\n\n<p>Presentations and handouts (three counted out of possible five): 30%</p>\n\n<p>Mid-term writing assignment (short&nbsp;<em>zhuan-</em>style piece plus explanation): 10%</p>\n\n<p>Final project: an outline or draft of a (fictional or non-fictional) history you know well, plus an interpretive essay explaining your choices and how they relate to the themes of the class (2000-3000 words total): 30%</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/571bb679-c05e-41db-9b6b-902c99b2ce5e.pdf' download=' Monsoon 2023.pdf'> Monsoon 2023.pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>"

Through an exploration of these histories the course will offer insights on the making of the Indian Ocean as a textured canvas that sustained Asian and African Sultanates in the high period of imperialism (19thcentury) which is conventionally viewed as the Ocean&rsquo;s European century.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>1.

People either hate them or love them, but they cannot ignore them. Fascinating, bewildering, and thought-provoking, megacities can teach us a lot of about our past, present, and the future. According to the United Nations, there were 33 megacities in 2018&mdash; cities with populations exceeding 10 million. What global, regional, national and local forces have combined over time&mdash; through history&mdash;to produce modern megacities? What explains their resilience, growth, diversity, and dynamism? How have megacities and its people coped with this unprecedented concentration of people and capital? What does it mean to live in such cities? Through this course, students will gain a strong footing into the world of historical, social scientific and humanistic scholarship on modern cities and urbanization. Furthermore, students will learn about the complicated dynamics between capitalism, modernity and cities; and will be encouraged to think about the relationship between history, the social sciences and the humanities.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p style=\"margin:0in\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\">This is an interdisciplinary course that will introduce students to some of the most important readings and themes&nbsp;in the field of global urban studies and urban history.

The study of ancient foodways is not merely an understanding of what people ate in the past rather it&rsquo;s a process of understanding the interrelation between human diet and ecological, biological, social and ideological processes. Therefore, the study of foodways can potentially provide us with sufficient evidence to reconstruct the social, cultural, political, economic, technological, and ecological aspects of ancient societies. Once regarded as a rather unexciting field of studies associated with basic subsistence, paleodietary studies have been rejuvenated in recent years by both recent advances in scientific methods and new theoretical perspectives. In this course, we aim to first understand the major shifts in human food practices, and the major theoretical and methodological advancements to reconstruct ancient diets and then how the information gathered can potentially be used to reconstruct social, political, climatic, and economic aspects of past societies and the health and wellbeing of the indigenous population practicing traditional diet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>COURSE EVALUATION</p>\n\n<p>Reading reviews (20%):&nbsp;Before class begins, you will submit a short synthesis (approx. 1 page single-spaced) on that week&rsquo;s readings.&nbsp;&nbsp;(10x2) = 20%</p>\n\n<p>Course Project (15%+25%=40%):&nbsp;Each student will do an individual project on examining any aspect of human diet from an anthropological and archaeological perspective.

As a state, it follows centuries of imperial dynasties whose complex legacies it sometimes claims and sometimes rejects. In the last two hundred years, China has experienced some of the most dramatic social and cultural transformations and some of the most violent conflicts of any region of the world. As it was incorporated into an international system dominated by Europe and the United States, it became an integral part of global history in new ways and, increasingly, a shaper of that history. Often imagined as a monolith, it is in fact deeply heterogeneous, home to multiple languages and ethnicities, countless local traditions, millions of adherents of major world religions, and sizable foreign communities. Today, China is the site of crucial questions concerning geopolitics, the environment, global health, and human rights. At the same time, it has inherited and continues to produce immense bodies of art and literature, distinctive belief systems and intellectual movements, and delicious food. In these and other capacities, it also informs the identities of millions of people of Chinese ancestry living around the world.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This course examines the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) and the early days of the Republic of China. It makes reference to Tibetan, Taiwanese, diasporic Chinese, and global histories as well. It offers systematic coverage of Qing expansion and crisis, Qing culture, encounters with Asia and the West, the emergence of nationalism, and the transition out of the dynastic state. In the process, it gives special attention to questions of race and ethnicity, gender, frontiers, global connections, and nation-building. It emphasizes historical thinking skills (e.g. understanding causation, contingency, agency, anachronism, meaning, and so on) and highlights the voices of historical figures, both powerful and ordinary, through translated primary sources.

Through the course, you will learn how to identify a research question, state your motivation for conducting this research (grounded in a well-surveyed literature review that identifies an apparent lacuna), develop testable hypotheses, and specify a methodological action plan for Spring 2024. As part of this plan, you will (a) briefly survey the various methods of data collection and analysis prevalent in IR research (historical and archival analysis, conducting interviews, discourse analysis, reading regression tables) and (b) interface with faculty experts on the subject/ and your supervisors on the dissertation.</p>\n\n<p>The final output of the course is a Research Prospectus of about 5,000 words, which will ultimately constitute a chapter of your overall dissertation. This Prospectus will be graded for the course and will be presented by you to the Department as a whole at the end of the Monsoon Semester. The overall grade for the course will be based on a midterm assignment, periodical pop quizzes, final prospectus, and participation in in-class discussions.</p>\n\n<p>Note: For Monsoon Semester 2023, this course is oriented towards ASP students in the department.

We will recall&nbsp;some of the important topics&nbsp;that you have done in&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculus at school level in 11-12,&nbsp; but it will be at a faster pace and at a deeper level than what is taught in high school. You should treat this course as revisiting calculus from a more matured perspective. The course differs from your usual school level calculus course in the sense that we will not follow a &quot;memorise a formula and learn hpw to apply it&quot; type of approach.

This course is a primer on how to identify, report and write news pieces. It includes an introduction to journalism fundamentals and ethics, the concept of news- what is noteworthy and why, techniques to find news stories, building news sources and practising various news writing formats.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe course will teach how to practice clear, accurate, informative, reporting and the art of listening, observing, interviewing and note-taking to dig out stories from strangers. The course will also focus on how to structure a news report and use research skills to find and evaluate sources, background the news, put stories in context, and check facts.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nWriting formats like a news report, features, profiles, analysis, investigative, narrative, and graphic non-fiction, will also be touched upon. Through editing workshops and a newsletter, the story will be given a final shape, like it is done in an actual newsroom.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nReading lists and a collective weekly news bulletin will be used to identify news pegs and what fits into the current news cycle. Through practice in the field and the best examples of national and international reports, the student will know how to write a first-hand ground report in a concise, authentic and contextual manner. &nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nIn this course you may encounter problems similar to those working journalists face: time and space limitations, missing facts, legal and ethical issues, meeting deadlines, and a sometimes-&shy;‐grouchy editor. </p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Basic writing style, standards and techniques, including a variety of ways to lead and structure a story.<br />\nThe importance of accuracy -&shy;‐-&shy;‐ accurate facts, but also accurate grammar and spelling.<br />\nThe concept of news itself -&shy;‐-&shy;‐ what is newsworthy, and why.<br />\nTechniques to find and focus story ideas.<br />\nReporting skills: listening, observing, interviewing and note-taking.<br />\nResearch skills to find and evaluate sources, background the news, put stories in context, and check the facts.<br />\nDifferences in story-&shy;‐telling styles and techniques&nbsp;<br />\nHow to write a story pitch.<br />\nHow to tell a story in a non-academic, simple, effective way</p>\n</div></div>"

As writers, we will investigate how to build and evolve elements such as space, time, character and dialogue that together create the dynamics of a scene.

We will study several articial&nbsp;<em>formal languages</em>, especially rst-order propositional and predicate logic, as well as modal and higher-order logic. We will think about their relation to the&nbsp;<em>natural language</em>&nbsp;of English, and to the world, as it is independent of all our speech.</p>\n\n<p>This is a demanding course, covering a good deal of challenging technical ground. It is still an introductory course, intended primarily to prepare philosophers for work across that subject. It is not an advanced course, exploring the field of logic for its own sake, in the manner of an advanced metaphysics course. But as an introductory logic course, it is more advanced than most (including, for instance, the logic course offered by the excellent department at Leeds, in Britain&rsquo;s prestigious Russell Group). Some of the topics covered towards the end are at the edge of active research. You will have to work hard, and you may well feel yourself struggling at times. If you are prepared to put in the work, and square up to the struggle, you will learn a lot, and be equipped both to follow and create philosophical arguments at the highest level.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nPlan</p>\n\n<p>Week 1: What is logic, and what do we want from it?</p>\n\n<p>See Logic Manual 1</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 2: Syntax and semantics of propositional&nbsp; logic</p>\n\n<p>See Logic Manuel 2</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 3: Formalization in propositional logic</p>\n\n<p>See Logic Manual 3</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 4: Syntax of predicate logic</p>\n\n<p>See Logic Manual 4</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 5: Semantics of predicate logic</p>\n\n<p>See Logic Manual 5</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 6: Natural deduction</p>\n\n<p>See Logic Manual 6</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 7: Formalization in predicate logic</p>\n\n<p>See Logic Manual 7</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 8: Identity etc</p>\n\n<p>See Logic Manuel 8</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 9: Modal propositional logic</p>\n\n<p>See Logic for Philosophers 6&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 10: Quantified modal logic</p>\n\n<p>See Logic for Philosophers 10</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 11: Second-order logic</p>\n\n<p>See Crash Course 3</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 12: Higher-order logic&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>See Crash Course 5</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Henceforward: Review/TBD</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>\n\n<p>Understand the fundamental ideas of logic.</p>\n\n<p>Translate sentences of English into well-formed sentences of logical languages, and vice versa.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Determine the formal properties of arguments, such as validity and soundness,&nbsp; as they are used in philosophical writing and elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Construct formal proofs for sentences of our formal languages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Recognise some of the philosophical implications and applications of logic.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The three main texts for this course are Volker Halbach&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://users.ox.ac.uk/~logicman/\"><em>The Logic Manual</em></a>, which covers propositional and predicate logic; Ted Sider&#39;s<a href=\"http://fitelson.org/piksi/logic_for_philosophy.pdf\">&nbsp;<em>Logic for Philosophy</em></a>, from which we will study modal logic; and Sider&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tedsider.org/teaching/higher_order_20/higher_order_crash_course.pdf\"><em>Crash Course on Higher-Order Logic</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em>which will cover the last portion on&nbsp;higher order logic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Other recommended free online&nbsp;resources are Tim Button&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytbu/OERs.html\">Open Education Resources</a>&nbsp;and Garson&#39;s&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://fitelson.org/piksi/garson_modal_logic.pdf\">Modal Logic for Philosophers</a>&nbsp;</em></p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Total grade: 30% homework, 30% midterm, 30% final, 10% participation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Expected grade boundaries: 90+ A, 80-90 B, 70-80 C, 60-70 D</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Attendance is mandatory.

The quiz is due 8:00 AM the day we discuss the reading but you should complete it much earlier.</p>\n\n<p>Perusall Annotation Assignments allow you to collaboratively read the readings by using the Perusall website. This allows you to share thoughts and questions with fellow students and to see their thoughts and questions. Canvas has a document detailing examples of annotations you can make on Perusall. Your Perusall annotations are due 8:00 AM the day we discuss the reading but you should write them far earlier.</p>\n\n<p>500 Word Papers are to help you practice thinking about and writing about the complicated ideas that are present in the books we read. They also help you understand those ideas through the feedback you receive. A rubric for 500 wordpapers is available on Canvas.</p>\n\n<p>Paper assignments will be given one of two grades: satisfactory or not yet satisfactory. You can resubmit any not yet satisfactory assignment for a regrade. You can only submit two papers per week. So, if you want to resubmit papers, do not leave all your resubmissions until the end of the semester.</p>\n\n<p>For an A grade: An average score of 75% or better on the reading quizzes.

Even those who personally do not follow any particular religion do not deny its overall importance. Nowadays, this inseparable aspect of the diverse human cultures is studied in different academic disciplines such as sociology of religion, psychology of religion, theology and the like. Philosophy of religion, however, scrutinises religious concepts, beliefs and doctrines employing a philosophical (rational) approach. There is a plenitude of deep and fundamental questions for which philosophy of religion tries to find rational answers. What is religion itself? How are we to explain the diversity of the existing religions? Are there any gods in the universe? One God (monotheism) or many gods (polytheism)? What are (if any) the evidences for or against the existence of God? Supposing that God exists, what are His attributes and how does He act in the universe? How can we think or talk about God? What is the relation between reason and faith and which one can support our religious beliefs? What is the relation between religion and science or religion and morality? How can we reasonably reconcile&nbsp;&nbsp;God&rsquo;s existence with the reality of evil? Does religion have any role in having a meaningful life? Will we continue to live after death (afterlife or resurrection)?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In this course we will deal with some of the most significant philosophical answers to the above queries and try to finally form our own perspectives through critical thinking and mutual discussion.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

There is also an attendance requirement which factors into your grade. Late Perusall annotations will not be accepted. 500 word papers and final exams or research papers are never late, but they have suggested due dates.</p>\n\n<p>Perusall Annotation Assignments allow you to collaboratively read the readings by using the Perusall website. This allows you to share thoughts and questions with fellow students and to see their thoughts and questions.</p>\n\n<p>500 Word Papers are to help you practice thinking about and writing about the complicated ideas that are present in the books we read. They also help you understand those ideas through the feedback you receive.</p>\n\n<p>The Take-Home Final Exam asks you to summarize points from some of the readings we have done, and then offer extensions of the idea or argument or critiques of the idea or argument. You may use your 500 word papers as a basis for your answers on the final exam. The exam is divided into a few parts, one part for each book we read. You can turn in parts of the final exam early.</p>\n\n<p>The Final Research Paper, which you can write instead of the final exam, is about 3,500 to 4,500 words. It asks you to do a bit of research in order to explore a topic raised in one of the books.</p>\n\n<p>Paper assignments will be given one of two grades: satisfactory or not yet satisfactory. You can resubmit any not yet satisfactory assignment for a regrade. You can only submit one paper per week. So, if you want to resubmit papers, do not leave all your resubmissions until the end of the semester.</p>\n\n<p>For an A grade: An average score of 75% or better on the Perusall assignments. Six or more satisfactory 500 word papers. An entirely satisfactory final exam or final research paper. Miss six or fewer class meetings.</p>\n\n<p>For a B grade: An average score of 70% or better on the Perusall assignments. Five or more satisfactory 500 word papers. Two or more satisfactory final exam portions or a satisfactory final research paper. Miss seven or fewer class meetings.</p>\n\n<p>For a C grade: An average score of 65% or better on the Perusall assignments. Four or more satisfactory 500 word papers. One or more satisfactory final exam portions or a satisfactory final research paper.

When the number of particle is so large it becomes possible to describe systems in equilibrium in terms not just of quantities inherited from mechanics &mdash; particle-number, volume, and energy, etc &mdash; but also ones that arise from statistical regularities and are purely thermodynamic &mdash; entropy, temperature, and chemical potential, etc. In statistical mechanics we begin with an explicit acknowledgment of the particle nature of many-body systems, whereas in thermodynamics we ignore the particle nature and begin with relationships between thermodynamic quantities. They are thus complementary, and each allows a deeper understanding of the other.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In this course we will use statistical mechanics to study simple classical and quantum systems, with and without interactions. We will begin by understanding how the thermodynamic description of a simple system like an ideal gas in equilibrium can be found from statistical mechanics, and go on to more complex systems, both classical and quantum, that would be difficult to grasp using thermodynamics alone. We will learn to describe fluctuations about equilibrium, which tell us about the stability of equilibrium states and are also related to equilibrium properties like specific heat and compressibility. And we will try to understand the basic ideas of equilibrium between phases, and, through computational exercises, of transformation between them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The mathematical formalism of statistical mechanics draws both on the laws of mechanics &mdash; classical or quantum, as appropriate &mdash; and on probability theory and statistics. Bridging the gap between the mathematics and the physics can be difficult, but it is rewarding, for starting from little one can get a lot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The computer has become an indispensable complement to mathematics in the physical description of many-particle systems. Computational statistical mechanics will not be taught in class by the instructor, but the graduate assistant will help students to learn it. It will form an integral part of the course in that every homework assignment will contain a computational problem, and the term project will be computational.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><u>Pre-requisites</u></p>\n\n<p>Thermal Physics (PHY 2610).

We will engage with contemporary theories and responses to the global condition of the rise of religion under conditions of colonialism and modernity. This course has two main sections: (a) a conceptual and theoretical survey of religion, modernity and secularity in contemporary political thought where the Euro-centrism of canonical sociological theories of religion, modernity, and secularity are questioned and challenged; (b) various responses to the global condition of the rise and relevance of religion in South Asia and Africa, and its engagement with modernity and secularity.</p>\n\n<p>A core objective of this lecture course is to bring together meta-theorization and area studies to highlight how current debates emerging from the experiences of the non-Western world challenge the Eurocentrism of concepts and theories of religion, modernity and secularity. We will not only study the reception of ostensibly &lsquo;Western&rsquo; concepts like modernity and secularity in South Asia and Africa but also understand how they underwent change as they were re-interpreted or rejected in new environments. Thus, we will put canonical theories under critical scrutiny to demonstrate the plurality and contested nature of what is considered to be &ldquo;religion&rdquo; or &ldquo;secular&rdquo; or &ldquo;modern&rdquo;. The course has a rigorous theoretical basis, and students will be familiarized with the current state-of-the-art debates on religion in the public-political sphere, secularism, secularization, and modernity. The course has a regional focus &ndash; South Asia (Undivided British India, and post-colonial nation-states of India and Pakistan) and Africa (Egypt and South Africa), and a disciplinary breadth that draws on a wealth of interdisciplinary perspectives (Political Science, Sociology, History, Philosophy, and Anthropology, amongst others).</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Course Objective and Learning Outcomes</p>\n\n<p>The aim of this course is to: a) critically examine canonical theories of religion, modernity and secularity; and b) engage in comparative social and political theorization by getting acquainted with non-western (South Asia and Africa) thought and societies which have challenged and reformulated canonical studies in religion, modernity and secularity in light of their particular socio-historical experiences. This course will equip students with perspectives that will enhance and broaden their understanding of the state, society, religion, secularism, and modernity beyond their &lsquo;Western&rsquo; interpretations in social and political theory. Apart from this, students will also learn how ideas travel and are transformed in that process. Thus, the entire course is designed to develop the student&rsquo;s knowledge of contemporary theoretical discourses on religion, modernity and secularity beyond the Western world, the capacity to critically and respectfully engage with diverse approaches and multiple perspectives emerging from non-Western thought and experience.</p>\n\n<p>Goals</p>\n\n<p>The course&rsquo;s inter-disciplinary focus and comparative framework aims to train students in comparative theorization by exploring a wide range of theoretical and regional perspectives. The course offers students:</p>\n\n<p>In-depth knowledge and understanding of major theories, methods, and debates in the field of religion, modernity and secularity, with a particular focus on South Asia and Africa;</p>\n\n<p>Develop skills in researching and writing about topics in and theorizations of religion, modernity and secularity;</p>\n\n<p>Develop skills in the presentation or communication of knowledge and understanding of debates related to religion, modernity and secularity, and as they pertain to regional, international, and transnational contexts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Outcomes</p>\n\n<p>Upon completion of the course students will be able to:</p>\n\n<p>Demonstrate their ability to engage analytically and critically with theories and conceptions of religion, modernity and secularity and their global impact.</p>\n\n<p>Demonstrate an analytical understanding of the varied impact of modernity, colonialism, and capitalism in South Asia and Africa and their lasting consequences in today&rsquo;s modern states in the region.</p>\n\n<p>Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of contemporary society and politics in South Asia and Africa.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>TBA</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Exam and Requirements</p>\n\n<p>Class participation is going to count for 20% of your final grade.

Many political movements appeal to some idea of equality. Critics of equality point out that humans are diverse and different.

There is equality of opportunity, equality of outcome, equality of status, equality of resources, equality of welfare, economic equality, gender equality, and so on. In this course, we will investigate the idea of equality and some of its complexity. We will start, in the first half, by discussing ideas of equality as distributive ideal. This includes looking at equality of opportunity, equality and bad luck, equality in the distribution of chances, and the different between equality and priority. In the second half of the course, we discuss ideas of equality as a relational ideal. What makes humans fundamentally equal? Why and when is discrimination wrong?

Cases in which we only need to know &ldquo;what works&rdquo; are rare. The choice between different policies requires us to trade off different values or trade off benefits to some against burdens to others. Some social scientists therefore seek to describe their task more modestly. The task of social policy as a discipline is to measure, at least estimate, the outcomes or effectiveness of a policy proposal. But even this modest task involves value judgments. How should we measure welfare? Or health? Or poverty? Or inequality? In this course we will connect political philosophy with public policy. Political philosophy is concerned with reasoning about value judgments.</p>\n\n<p>Each week we will connect one debate in political philosophy with a debate in public policy. The public policy debates are often examples. Philosophical debates on inequality, for instance, bear on many policy questions. However, for this course it helps to focus our discussion by looking at one policy case in particular. There will be student presentations on the policy cases and we will work together to draw the connections between the political philosophy material and the social policy debate in India.</p>\n\n<p>The course is intended for two groups of students. First, it is intended for students interested in entering public policy. This means students interested in working for policy-oriented NGOs, think tanks, IAS, public interested spirited litigation, political parties, and so on. The course shall help students sensitize about value questions as they arise in public policy. At the end of the course, students shall be able to identify implicit value questions and reason about them critically. The second group of students are students interested in political philosophy and political theory. Many courses in political theory are, well, theoretical. This course seeks to apply and make relevant debates in political philosophy for real-world concerns. Students interested in political theory can benefit from this applied focus.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>In the course well will draw on political philosophy/theory as well as economics and law. Basic knowledge of political theory, political or moral philosophy is highly recommended as evidenced by completion of Introduction to Political Theory, Western Political Thought I, or an equivalent course in political theory and/or philosophy. Students without such prior courses should approach me with a short description of their background before registration. Prior knowledge of economics and/or law is helpful but not required.</p>\n </div></div>"

You should be familiar with the definition of psychology as the scientific study of thought and behaviour. What does this mean exactly? Understanding psychology as an empirical science will be our starting point. Without rigorous standards for examining human behaviour, psychology would be little more than intuition, opinion, whim or belief. A large part of this course will be devoted to a critical analysis of things you might have already learned in psychology &ndash; some of which might, in fact, be classic misconceptions, in other words &ldquo;myths&rdquo;&hellip; Waiting for us to be explored and find out!&nbsp;<br />\nWe will parallel some of what students are learning in Psychology-1001 but will focus on exploring psychology as a science, including aspects of how to study questions of interest, critical thinking, and analysis of general findings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Structure of the Course</strong><br />\nThis course introduces the scientific discipline of psychology and familiarises the student with basic concepts within it. We look at how researchers and practitioners conduct their work and the various challenges, myths, misunderstandings and misconceptions that the discipline often has to grapple with. First and foremost, this is not a class composed only of lectures. We will devote class time to discussions, demonstrations and in-class presentations, which will add to your appreciation of the application of scientific psychological knowledge in our lives (: Psychology is fun :) However fun it can be, you will need to put in a considerable amount of work. Please come to class with a mindful, interested, curious &amp; courageous mindset, prepared to ask your questions and ready to respond to mine and discuss: I very much look forward to healthy lively discussions in class, as a whole but also in small groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\nPlease note, that this is only the second time I am taking this course, therefore and as in all my courses, there will be a fair amount of flexibility in the course timing as well as in the shaping &ldquo;the course&rdquo; of the course according to your interests, especially in the small group presentations part during the second half of the course!</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Discussion Sections</strong><br />\nWe will be holding discussion sections during the course of the semester to help you review course material and gain further understanding about the application of the concepts covered in class. To further your understanding and assist with clearing queries, discussion sections in smaller groups will be held once a week with the TF(s). Please register for a DS via LMS.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Knowledge:</strong><br />\nState the goals and methods of science as they allow for evaluation of the quality of the evidence, distinguishing between evidence and pseudoscience.<br />\nArticulate the rationale and the need for considreing psychology among the sciences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Meta-Skills:</strong><br />\nRead, summarise, paraphrase, critique primary reserach in psychology.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Personal:</strong><br />\nApply theoretical principles from psychology to enhance you everday life - especially student life.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Reading Material</strong><br />\nE-copies of the main textbooks will be shared with you via Google Classroom.<br />\nThese are the two main textbooks:<br />\n.

We will start by understanding how single neurons can perform computations and can be understand in the same framework as electronic circuitry. We will understand then how complex information processing and calculation can happen as a result of the ways in which multiple neurons signal to and connect to one another. We will then look at how the brain is organized, and study the nervous systems of humans and other animals, approaching this through the lens of the various tools that neuroscientists have historically used to study neuronal connectivity and the brain. We will cover the electrical properties of nerve cells and voltage dependent membrane permeability; channels, transporters, neurotransmitters and their receptors; synaptic transmission; the brain and its development and plasticity. We will also study complex brain functions and the neural basis of complex cognition, learning and information processing. We explore the ways in which the neuronal processes underlying behaviour have been deduced from various animal models of behaviour, and ways in which genetics and the environment shape the systems that produce behaviour during development. We will explore sensory perception and motor movement in depth.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This course is offered to both biology and psychology students and covers the same ground as a standard course on Biological Psychology. It aims to introduce neuroscience as a specialized discipline, and to enable students to understand how a biological system is able to signal information, perform computations and produce behaviour. This course will also use teaching tools in the discussion section that enable an intuitive grasp of neural processes, such as simulations to understand how various factors affect neuronal functioning, and experiments to demonstrate neurons in action and how various interventions affect neuronal functioning.</p>\n\n<p>In order to equip students to become familiar with the level of rigour needed to think through some of these questions, we will also look at how to survey and evaluate literature in the field of biological psychology, how to quickly but accurately read graphs and how to cite literature.</p>\n\n<p>We then turn to the question of how we learn, how we absorb new material, the ways in which our neural systems tend to conflate correlation and causation, and how critical thinking and environmental training can change learning patterns and feedback to change the structure of the brain. We will take a quick look at the neural basis of complex and interesting phenomena such as motivation, emotion, cognition, consciousness, attention. We will end with an exploration of how neural systems can exhibit pathology, how neurodegeneration and trauma can impact the system, and how medication and drugs work, with a focus on the limitations of what we collectively understand and the pressing need for further research to take forward the field. This course eventually hopes to make clear the relationship between brain and behaviour.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The recommended textbook for this course is Biological Psychology by James W. Kalat (Kalat, J. W. (2008). Biological Psychology. Calif: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning). I have a physical copy of the 11th edition. A soft copy of the 10th edition is also available on Canvas - the 10th and 11th editions do not differ hugely and I&rsquo;d recommend this for anyone who is comfortable with reading on their computers.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For additional reading students can refer to:</p>\n\n<p>Kandel, E. R., Schwartz, J. H., &amp; Jessell, T. M. (2000). Principles of neural science. New York: McGraw-Hill, Health Professions Division.</p>\n\n<p>Purves, D., Augustine, G., Fitzpatrick, D., Hall, W., Lamantia, A.-S., &amp; White, L. (2012) Neuroscience. Sinauer Associates, Inc.: Sunderland, MA.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This class will have fourteen weekly quizzes, all open book. The idea behind this is to keep providing conceptual testing to enable you to check the soundness with which you have understood the material. There will be no testing requiring rote learning or simply checking familiarity with information. The best 9 out of 14 will count towards 90% of your final grade.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Your participation in class or even by email or Canvas will count towards the remaining 10%. In terms of class participation, questions in class will be counted, as will engaging on Canvas, by email, etc. Your attendance counts as part of your participation grade: 5% of your total grade is class attendance and 2% is DS attendance.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The quizzes will be administered by Canvas. This requires a laptop or phone in class. The quizzes will be administered at the beginning of the Thursday class, and should take 25 minutes. The quizzes will be autograded and returned with the answer scheme by the following Tuesday at the latest, for immediate feedback.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For Graduate students (MA/PhD), the only difference between this course as offered for undergraduate and graduate students is that the assignment is mandatory for graduate students, and it counts for 30% of the final grade (and accordingly, only the best 6 quizzes count towards the final grade).</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Your attendance counts as part of your participation grade: 5% of your total grade is class attendance and 2% is DS attendance.&nbsp;Attendance: will be marked as a component of the participation grade, but not as a barrier to doing exams, etc. Missing class is a student&rsquo;s loss and will impact the class participation grades. For students who miss class for unavoidable reasons, they can visit the TA, during office hours for help. All those who are unable to attend classes due to medical reasons are requested to email the TAs&nbsp; (and cc&#39;d to the TFs, but please not to Bittu!), with a copy of their medical note or prescription (with the date clearly mentioned) along with their emails.</p>\n</div></div>"

We will also cover the related dysfunctions, including developmental and neurological ones, with one specific focus on rhythm and timing in the human brain as the basis for music, language - and even movement.&nbsp;<br />\nWe will start with the inner ear and move on into the brain, along the ascending auditory pathway, discover specialisation of the relevant brain structures, learn about the role of expertise (e.g. musicianship) and go full circle by touching on predictions and top-down projections.<br />\nEach of the lectures will in the following session be complemented by presentations and critical discussion of related articles of your choice, which will range from relevant classical studies to hot-of-the-press ones.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Knowledge</strong>: &nbsp;An in-depth understanding of the human auditory system, backed up by animal models, and its &ldquo;high-end functions&rdquo; of rhythm, speech, music and more in the human brain; getting to know state-of-the-art research, ranging from the past decades to hot-off-the-press.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Meta-Skills:</strong> Understanding, explaining and discussing research articles, including aspects of critical thinking, as well as the development of new research ideas from there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Personal development:</strong> Discovering or shaping your personal research interests, with the possibility to partake in cutting edge science on rhythm and time perception in the human brain, and gaining insights into the world of research and publishing.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Recommended Textbooks</strong> (not mandatory but to choose from to back up or deepen your understanding of the respective topics)<br />\nE-copies of the textbooks will be shared with you via the AMS/Google Classroom.<br />\nAll relevant r<strong>eserach articles</strong>/chapters to be read or used for the presentations will also be shared.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>1.

They are designed to assess your learning of the relevant knowledge and understanding of the auditory system and the higher cognitive skills including rhythm, language and music as covered in the course. The first one will be an in-class one consisting of questions requiring circumscribed concrete answers about the lecture material; the second one will be a 48h essay-type take-home exam, based on a choice of research topic questions for you to select from, which are open to more elaborate or even &ldquo;blue skies&#39;&#39; answers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Research Article Presentation (20% each of final grade):</strong><br />\nOver the course of the semester you will partake in two rounds of scientific papers. These papers will typically be peer-reviewed research articles, published in more or less &ldquo;prestigious&rdquo; journals. In each round, you will study, present, discuss and critique with the group in class one peer-reviewed journal research article that will be related to the topics of the lecture. The presentation will be held in groups of 3 (or 2 - depending on the class size). Each presentation will be 20 min long, plus up to 10 min for discussion of the research and the paper (methods, results, conclusions, possible future directions to go into), during which the instructor can also give some additional background -or even anecdotal- knowledge on the topic, followed by up to 10 min of feedback from the group and instructors. Precise guidelines for this assignment will be discussed in class and shared with you. Also the list of the research papers and the PDFs of the papers will be shared with you on AMS/google classroom, where you can have a look at them and then choose your three favourites, so we can create the list of presentations for the first, and later on the second round. In case anything remains unclear or you would like some help with choosing your paper to present, do not hesitate to contact myself or the team. In case you have a research paper that you are interested in and wish to present that fits the topic of the course but is not on the course list, please feel free to reach out to me or the team (:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Participation (20% of final grade):</strong><br />\nParticipation will be a composite score from attendance, participation in class by asking questions and engaging in discussions during lectures and research article presentations details, as well as the possible participation in research requirements which will be communicated separately.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final Grading Scale: Points &amp; Letter Grades</strong><br />\n90-100 A&nbsp;<br />\n85 ~ 89 A &ndash;&nbsp;<br />\n80 ~ 84 B +&nbsp;<br />\n75 ~ 79 B&nbsp;<br />\n70 ~ 74 B &ndash;&nbsp;<br />\n65 ~ 69 C +&nbsp;<br />\n60 ~ 64 C&nbsp;<br />\n55 ~ 59 C-&nbsp;<br />\n50 ~ 54 D+&nbsp;<br />\n45 ~ 49 D&nbsp;<br />\n40 ~ 44 D-&nbsp;<br />\n&lt;40 F<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Attendance</strong><br />\nAttendance is mandatory.

If you cannot attend, let us know as soon as you know (again, the latest 24h in advance except in emergencies).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Discussion sessions &amp; &ldquo;extra office hours&rdquo;</strong> are voluntary and offered in a played-by ear fashion (:&nbsp;or based on students&rsquo; requests. They are meant to clarify any questions about the lecture material as well as to deepen your understanding beyond the course material. The &ldquo;extra office hours&rdquo; are offered to help you with preparing your presentations, and will be arranged with the instructors or the TAs over the course of the course.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes of caution:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Please note that the instructor reserves the right to change any of the above criteria but will do so in a transparent manner, and only in the best interest for the course and the students.</p>\n\n<p>It is your responsibility to check for notes and announcements by email or on google classroom in case you missed a class or part of one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If you are late, and if you miss information announced at the beginning or during the class, it is your responsibility to find out about that by either asking your peers or contacting the TA to fill you in at a mutually convenient time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There will be no grade changes for the individual. So please do not ask for a grade increase at the end of the semester or for an exception made for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Dates and timelines will not be adjusted for any of the assessment components (except for health-based accommodations).</p>\n\n<p>All relevant information will be made available to you well in advance.</p>\n\n<p>We all know about issues with online and computer-based work and strongly encourage you to make multiple copies on different systems (phone, laptop, desktop, library computer etc), as well as to keep a copy on cloud platforms, and we are open to accepting handwritten documents sent as images when absolutely necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Withdrawal from the course if needed is your responsibility. The instructor has nothing to do with this process. In order to complete a withdrawal, you must fill out the appropriate form and submit it to the appropriate authorities.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Classroom &amp; Schedule Details:</strong><br />\n<strong>Times</strong>: Tue &amp; Fri 3.00 - 4.30&nbsp; pm<br />\n<strong>Classroom</strong>: TBC<br />\n<strong>Start of the course</strong>: 29.

How is social order made and maintained in stateless societies? What is the difference between stateless societies and stateless persons? How are states formed and what forms do they take, when and where? &nbsp;For instance, how does colonialism rationalise the use of power? What is the relationship of legitimacy to power in the making of the modern state? And what are the forms of belonging and resistance to the authority of the state? What is the meaning of sovereignty? How does bureaucracy work? Who is a citizen? What are the processes through which membership to the nation-state is achieved? Like all sociology and anthropology cores, the course must contend with the complex and oftentimes confusing relationship&nbsp;between chronological and conceptual evolution across different scales and diverse contexts, working through history, social theory, and ethnographies of the state. In the process, we will also reflect on the role of the State in shaping the state of our discipline and others.&nbsp;Inevitably, the problem of capitalisation (State/state) is one among many problems of power we will have to deal with and try to evade.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>1.

Equally relevant is to question what constitutes anthropological knowledge and how it is produced. This course engages with these issues by drawing on scholarship in political ecology, agrarian studies, and the Anthropocene.</p>\n\n<p>The course is designed as a graduate seminar, which means it is reading- and writing-intensive. It has a component of student-led discussions for which you will need to form small groups and I will work closely with each group to help you select topics and readings.

In this course we engage with religious and secular diagnostic traditions, and the ways in which these forms of knowledge shape the experience and understanding of &ldquo;unreason&rdquo;. We examine the emergence of modern diagnostic categories such as depression, anxiety, addiction, and schizophrenia, and debates on changing perceptions of the normal and the pathological. Drawing on anthropology, psychiatry, philosophy, literature and cinema, we follow the emergence, translation and critique of diagnostic categories across different parts of the contemporary world. We begin with a canonical &ldquo;history of madness&rdquo; by Michel Foucault, which sets out key discursive shifts that led to contemporary formations of medical knowledge and power.</p>\n\n<p>We take up longstanding debates on whether or not psychiatric categories are inherently western, as well as anthropological attempts to understand the ways in which such categories are translated and deployed in new cultural contexts. We engage with traditions of spiritual healing and the ways in which such traditions remain alive in the contemporary world. We read classic ethnographies of mental illness and closely examine three conditions of local and global significance &ndash; addiction, depression, and schizophrenia, placed within the wider contention that mental health/illness may be one of the most urgent albeit elusive and shape-shifting crises in the contemporary world. This course aims to introduce students to anthropological approaches to mental health, to engage with varied concepts of psychic distress, the experiences of patients and caregivers, and the instability of the idea of the normal.</p>\n\n<p>This course seeks to familiarize students with current debates and older and newer literatures in the anthropology of mental health, through which we learn ways of thinking about subjectivity, selfhood, the history and emergence of particular diagnostic categories, the cultural valences of scientific categories and their modes of translation into new contexts. We also engage other ways of understanding such experiences for instance through forms of religion, from the vantage point of families and institutions, and the varied ways in which suffering and healing are experienced in the contemporary world. Welcome to what we hope will be an adventure of thought and learning!&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

It examines how places, cultures and people are constructed through representations &mdash; visual and written &mdash; both by outsiders as well as local communities. Students will engage with critical questions about the ethics of representation in imaging &lsquo;other&rsquo; places and people through photography and writing, the political and social processes that inform the making of tradition, and the entanglements of politics and culture in the formation of regional and national identities. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">We will study colonial and contemporary photography, travel accounts, art historical writing, contemporary fiction, material culture at temples and monasteries, performative rituals, museum displays, films and representations in popular culture. We will visit Buddhist monasteries at Majnu-ka-Tilla in Delhi to study material culture through its use, and look at the role that cultural markers such as architecture, clothing and food play in marking places of specific communities and cultures.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">A key area of study will be major museum collections of Himalayan art in India, Europe and North America. Some of the questions we will be exploring include: How are cultures constructed through acts of museumisation? How did the field of Himalayan Art emerge? Where do we locate this field; which geographical areas and religions are made emblematic of this discipline; which cultures are excluded and why? How were museum collections built and in what historical circumstances? What curatorial strategies are used to reconstruct the auras of objects? How are sacred objects of use segregated into categories of art and ethnography? </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">The course will examine the recent museum-making impulse in the Himalayas through case studies of a range of museums situated in these borderlands &mdash; war memorial museums, community museums of conflict and trade route artifacts in the Kargil district of Ladakh, and museums in Buddhist monasteries to understand the relationship between heritage and religion, the impact of the movement of things from sacred sites to &lsquo;secular&rsquo; museums, and to ask how a politics of remembrance may manifest in cultural production. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">The course will conclude with an introduction to contemporary Tibetan art and Tibetan/ Buddhist culture-in-exile where we will explore modern and contemporary art, poetry and literature, films and pop culture.</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">By the end of the course, students:</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\">&bull; will be familiar with the broad field of the visual and material cultures in the Western Himalayas in Tibet, Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh.<br />\n&bull; will learn about major museums and collections of Himalayan Art and be able to critically analyze the framing of objects as art/ ethnography, and questions of provenance research and label writing in object displays.<br />\n&bull; will be conversant with critical questions around heritage, the politics of museums and the role of tradition in the construction of contemporary cultural identities.<br />\n&bull; will acquire the critical tools interrogate the nature and impact of representation of regions, cultures and communities through images and written texts.<br />\n&bull; will be able to critically read images and texts, with a focus on meaning making through vocabularies and and terminologies, and apply this critical thinking through a<br />\npractical curatorial project with each student curating an independent exhibition.</span></p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><strong>Preliminary/ Select Bibliography:</strong><br />\n&bull; Anand, Dibyesh. &ldquo;Western Colonial Representations of the Other- The Case of Exotica Tibet&rdquo;, <em>New Political Science 29</em> (1) March 2007, 23-42.<br />\n&bull; Appadurai, Arjun. &ldquo;The Production of locality&rdquo; <em>Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of Globalization</em>, University of Minnesota Press, 1996,178-200.<br />\n&bull; Appadurai, Arjun. &ldquo;Putting Hierarchy in its Place&rdquo; <em>Cultural Anthropology</em> Vol. 3, No. 1, Place and Voice in Anthropological Theory (Feb., 1988), pp. 36-49.<br />\n&bull; Banerjee, Sandeep. &ldquo;Not Altogether Unpicturesque: Samuel Bourne and the Landscaping of the Victorian Himalaya&rdquo;, <em>Victorian Literature and Culture</em>, Vol. 42, No. 3 (2014), Cambridge University Press, 351-368.<br />\n&bull; Bishop, Peter (2000) <em>The Sacred Myth of Shangri-La: Tibet, Travel Writing and the Western Creation of Sacred Landscape</em>.

Although it is no longer a requisite skill for contemporary artists, a high proportion would still agree that irrespective of whatever material they might chose to work in, they &lsquo;think&rsquo; in terms of drawings. Drawing is more than simply a skill in the sense that it offers a path to self-discovery, revealing a cast of mind, an imaginative capacity and a mode of perception.</p>\n\n<p>This course encourages students to re-think and re-imagine the human body beyond a representational image, as an entity with constant trans-mutative possibilities in terms of form, functionality and aesthetics. Through a combination of practice and discourse, the course encourages explorations beyond human anatomy by focusing on the varied manifestations and meanings ascribed to the human figure, vis-&agrave;-vis the body, in the context of visual art and beyond.</p>\n\n<p>Students will be introduced to contemporary artistic practices and deliberations on artistic visions, experiences and wisdoms that push the boundaries of excepted notions of &lsquo;high&rsquo; art and critique hierarchies of attitude. Tracing the history of figure drawing as a genre that goes back to Classical antiquity to Italian Renaissance, extending into the 18th century French academia and the 19th century Victorian Era, students will get a broad overview of how the established notion of accuracy and idealized beauty continues to be challenged and reinvented as artists take on a variety of approaches to drawing the human figure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The course looks at how the idealized notion of body is challenged and replaced with bodies that are bruised, grotesque and out of proportions with visible stretch marks, skin hair, wrinkles and pigmentation. How has the conscious shift towards drawing from memory and imagination as opposed to drawing from a live model or from photographic references allowed artists to create works that are often loaded with political commentary and emotive power?</p>\n\n<p>In this course, students have the flexibility to work with both analog and digital mediums and materials in enabling them to connect to their own context, concerns and interests with a sense of immediacy by using the human figure as a trigger.</p>\n\n<p>The frameworks we will be working through the course include:</p>\n\n<p>Understanding the various kinds of representations of human figure - from different social and cultural contexts. Locating discursive modes of representation.</p>\n\n<p>Probing ideas of beauty, identity, sexuality and gender, through human form.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding space-time and memory in the context of human body and its representation.</p>\n\n<p>Exploring the human figure in contemporary drawings under the broad categorizations of the body, self, personal lives, social realty and fictions.</p>\n\n<p>Reflecting on processes of overlapping, erasures and incision as acts layered with emotive and intuitive sensibilities.</p>\n\n<p>Developing an individual methodology /strategy to figurative drawing.</p>\n\n<p>The course will unfold over three modules; each spread over four weeks respectively, and will include both theoretical readings and practical assignments. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Module 1</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The human figure in visual arts:</strong></p>\n\n<p>A historical perspective, a cultural and social perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Representing human body- a repository of concepts.</p>\n\n<p>Overview- Western naturalism through Renaissance, Human form in Egyptian Drawing, Indian painting and Human form.</p>\n\n<p>Basic observational drawings.</p>\n\n<p>Portraiture and history painting.</p>\n\n<p>The renaissance body- Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael, Durer</p>\n\n<p>Representing flesh and desire- Boucher, Ingre, Rubens,</p>\n\n<p>Modernity and Body - Humor, satire and politics of&nbsp; expressing the Body in painting, sculpture.

It is an evolving field that is difficult to understand and memorize, making it a challenging subject to learn. This course focuses on introducing fundamental concepts rather than a comprehensive coverage of the subject. UG, ASP and PhD students who want to grasp key concepts of how the immune system works should consider this course. This immunology course can complement student interest / knowledge of cancer therapy, vaccine biology and infectious diseases.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the pre-requisites for this course? </strong>It is mandatory that students have a background in basic biology. The immune system uses molecular mechanisms that are a part of cell and molecular biology courses (Introduction to biology II and III), so these are a prerequisite for BIO-3443/6443.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the expectations from students?</strong> The topics being covered are interconnected so it is important that students clarify doubts as we progress through the course. Students are expected to take active part in their learning experience and contribute to an environment conducive to learning in the following ways: Staying current with any mandatory reading / videos / knowledge checks / quizzes / assignments etc; meeting deadlines; sharing thoughts, questions or doubts in class; actively participating in discussions; being enthusiastic about learning the subject, being mentally and physically present in class.</p>\n\n<p>One 15-minute session of office hours per student is mandatory in the first month of the course.</p>\n\n<p>Academic integrity is a must. Any plagiarism or cheating will be dealt with according to the university policy.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>After completing this course students will be able to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Identify components of the immune system. (Unit 1)</li>\n\t<li>Describe how diseased / infected cells are identified (Unit 1)</li>\n\t<li>Describe the key processes in initiation of an immune response. (Unit 1)</li>\n\t<li>Explain how the immune system is able to respond to so many different pathogens, even those that have not been encountered previously. (Unit 2)</li>\n\t<li>Describe some general and specialized immune mechanisms used to control pathogens. (Unit 2)</li>\n\t<li>Explain how immune cells move through the body. (Unit 2)</li>\n\t<li>Describe the fundamental principle behind some common techniques used in immunology research. (Unit 3)</li>\n\t<li>Describe how the immune system is able to discriminate non-self from self or harmful from harmless. (Unit3)</li>\n</ol>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>We will be loosely following the general structure of the textbook How the immune system works by&nbsp;Lauren Sompayrac. The instructor may also direct students to specific videos / articles or sections from immunology textbooks (Janeway&#39;s Immunobiology or Kuby&#39;s Immunology). Copies of all are available in the library.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Course assessment will be done using absolute grading based on the assignments listed below. This can deviate a little from the plan below based on the instructor&rsquo;s discretion.</p>\n\n<p><u>Attendance (10 marks)</u>. Learning through interacting with your peers is an important part of this course. You can miss up to 4 unexcused classes. Sick leave beyond that will need a doctor&rsquo;s note and unexcused absences will&nbsp; result in loss of 2 marks per class. Absence from 7&nbsp;or more classes will result in loss of a grade.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><u>Class participation (10 marks).</u> This can be earned by giving a 10-minute recap of a topic covered in the previous classes (students can do this with or without slides), making a knowledge check quiz for the class, flash cards or by participating in class discussion (in class&nbsp; or by text in google classrooms).</p>\n\n<p><u>Written exams (80 marks).</u> There will be 4 written assessments (1 hour, 20 marks each). These will be quiz or short answer type tests conducted in class. The best three (a total of 60 marks, which will count for 80% of the grade) will be counted towards the final grade. It is mandatory for students take at least 3 of the exams. Please talk to the instructor about how to make up in case you are unable to take three exams.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>The instructor will be following guidelines in the OAA document titled Ashoka Guidelines on Class Attendance and Accommodations OAA (version 2022-01-31).</strong></p>\n\n<p>Learning through interacting with your peers is an important part of this course. As a minimum general attendance policy, students may miss three sessions of 90 minutes each without penalty. For such absences, students do not need to submit any supporting evidence such as doctor&rsquo;s notes. Note that this does not apply to sessions during which exams or other assignments are scheduled. For any absences the instructor would appreciate an email before class where possible as some class exercises are tailored for a group&nbsp;or need a full class. Sick leave beyond the three unexcused absences will need a doctor&rsquo;s note and unexcused absences will&nbsp; result in loss of 2 marks per class. Absence from 7 or more classes will result in loss of a grade. Please see sections 7 and 8 in the Ashoka guidelines for absences in the other situations (representing the university as an athlete or artist, absences related to documented disability or mental health issues).</p>\n</div></div>"

These relics range from the garbage that people have generated as they have lived their daily lives to deliberate constructions like temples and fortifications. Extraction of information from fragmentary material remains and sites require the ingenuity of modern science ranging from dating techniques and experimental methods that is capable of analyzing tiny amounts of archaeological materials to reveal the nuances of the human past. In this course, we will learn how archaeologist piece together the human past using sophisticated scientific techniques. We will learn the history of archaeological science. And how it has helped rediscover past human actions and how these advanced techniques can solve future puzzles about our own history and existence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Evaluation system:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Final exam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30%</p>\n\n<p>*Hands-on exercises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20% (2 x 10%)</p>\n\n<p>Research Presentation:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20%</p>\n\n<p>Research Paper:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30%</p>\n\n<p>*Students will prepare reports of&nbsp;any two&nbsp;exercises.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Attendance Policy:&nbsp;70%</p>\n\n<p>Assessment rubric for audit students:&nbsp;Research Paper</p>\n</div></div>"

The complex method of cultural confluence between India and China was initially a spontaneous contact that happened primarily as a result of an intellectual quest by the Buddhist monks. This literary-historical comparative study reveals the spontaneous interliterary contacts between these two civilizations. The Indian literary and philosophical values contributed to the formation and the development of the new trends of the strange tales in the recipient literature. This exchange between India and China is important because Chinese literature is enriched by Indian literature not only as a consequence of direct contacts but also because of the inner potentialities of the emitting Indian phenomenon and this happened in spite of the existence of China&rsquo;s own strong and powerful cultural heritage. The interliterary reciprocity of these two countries formed a concrete literary and cultural relation and the impact of the source culture was almost undistinguishable and had a creative manifestation in the recipient narrative tradition. The creative manifestation of the narrative tradition due to this direct impact from the source culture was only possible for the recipient culture of China because it already had its own strong and written literary tradition. This course will conduct the thematic comparative study of the strange tales of China and India and its migration to Afroeurasian region. This study will execute a systematic analysis with reference to the cultural, aesthetic and intellectual situation while looking into the lapses and the surviving and the residual elements.</p>\n\n<p>The Unit &ndash;I touches upon the advent of Buddhism and the transmission of the Buddhist elements via the translation of the miraculous indigenous strange tale tradition to which Buddhism contributed immensely. A short introduction to the bianwen genre which is considered to be a direct descendent of the Indian gatha tradition will be introduced. Following the Confucian ideology which emphasise greatly on the documentation of history, the narratives that included supernatural elements were documented as a history of the other world. Buddhism, Confucianism and Daoism together had contributed to the growth of the strange tale tradition in China.</p>\n\n<p>Unit 2 will examine the emergence of China as a Buddhist realm and the phase of termination and also discuss the Tang-India diplomatic relations during premodern time. With this advent of Buddhism the translation of Buddhist literatures escalated. The course will discuss the problems and prospects of the early Chinese translations which helped in the linguistic development and evolution.</p>\n\n<p>Unit 3 will discuss the spread of Buddhism across and beyond Asia. Buddhism in China has immensely contributed to the evolution of narrative traditions in China. This unit will illustrate the Indic philosophical concepts and estimate its influence on different narrative genres through the readings of folktales and strange stories. The connection between the historicity and fictionality of the narratives can be understood through the readings of different genres of literatures.</p>\n\n<p>Unit 4 will examine four motifs/themes that are essentially Buddhist and the course can study their reception and acclimatization within the Chinese strange tale tradition. Parallely the course will examine the evolution of similar motifs in the Indian Sanskrit tradition. The purpose of the course also is to draw a pattern expressed through thematic resemblances of the strange and the fantastic stories of the medieval Indian and Chinese literary traditions. With this parallel study it can also be established that after traveling to China, Buddhist philosophy influenced indigenous Chinese folk and popular story tradition and the idea of Buddhism eventually got merged with Daoism and indigenous story tradition.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>1.

You will be required to turn in short written assignments every week. For longer assignments, (the Mid-Term and the End-Term essays) you will be offered multiple rounds of feedback. You will also need to rehearse regular habits of reading (of academic texts and wider materials) and responding (to prompts, or given materials). You can expect it to have a strong participation and interaction component, and can expect to work on projects both individually and in collaboration with your coursemates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>An exhaustive list of reading materials will be uploaded soon but you can expect it to be diverse in form and content.

While primary materials may range from peer reviewed articles to court verdicts to short films to memes, the focus will remain squarely on enabling and urging the student to read the text closely and to help them inculcate a range of scholarly habits. A major component of the course is to instill among the students an appreciation for structure and precision both in thought and writing, a dichotomy which the course will also attempt to bridge by engaging the student in discussions and debates. At the end of the semester, the students will not only be able to write a well researched essay but will also begin to interrogate the mechanisms through which knowledge is produced and reproduced.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Reading:</p>\n\n<p>1. Breaking down texts into identifiable parts.</p>\n\n<p>2. Making patterns and connections across texts</p>\n\n<p>3. Building reading stamina and the ability to select texts</p>\n\n<p>4. Understanding textual context, genre and source material</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Writing&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>1. Developing the craft of outlining, revising, editing</p>\n\n<p>2.

Nor is any ICT course geared towards preparing you specifically for a career in a particular subject or field. Rather, you can expect it to guide you in transition out of how you approached academic work in school to how you might approach it in a university setting, and to sharpen your understanding of what it means to be critical, questioning and deliberate in your approach to the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This is a writing intensive course. You will be required to turn in short written assignments every week. For longer assignments, (the Mid-Term and the End-Term essays) you will be offered multiple rounds of feedback. You will also need to rehearse regular habits of reading (of academic texts and wider materials) and responding (to prompts, or given materials). You can expect it to have a strong participation and interaction component, and can expect to work on projects both individually and in collaboration with your coursemates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>An exhaustive list of reading materials will be uploaded soon but you can expect it to be diverse in form and content. All reading will be done in class barring the odd unavoidable take home reading assignment.&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The ICT will be graded on a number of elements.

The task of explaining it in theoretical terms, however, is fraught with many problems. On the one hand, it has been likened to concepts and practices like translation, transposition, interpretation, rewriting, palimpsest, a dialogic process, and performance. On the other hand, its intertextual quality, which marks every text, makes it difficult to answer what is not an adaptation. In this course, we will engage with this ubiquitous phenomenon by thinking critically about questions like: What is adaptation? Why adapt? What does adaptation do? How is it different from other forms of cultural production? In pursuing these and other related questions, the course seeks to open a dialogue between theory and praxis of adaptation. While we will read and discuss theoretical texts by Plato, Aristotle, Bharata, Anandavardhana, Sigmund Freud, Mikhail Bakhtin, Walter Benjamin, Roland Barthes, Erving Goffman, Diana Taylor, Linda Hutcheon, and Jonathan Gil Harris, our thinking and conversations on adaptation will also be guided by an engagement with the practitioner&rsquo;s craft, especially from the theatre. We will look at how adapters like Shakespeare theorize adaptation in their practice, and go on to frame/create our own adaptations&mdash;for the page and stage&mdash;to arrive at a practice-based understanding of the nature and social, cultural, aesthetic, and political implications of adaptation.</p>\n</div></div>"

Is it simply something that we needed for trading? If so, then&nbsp;money would be a constraint - a thing without which trades can&#39;t happen. What about alternative trading arrangements like barter or credit? Why&nbsp;is barter, credit, or a system that keeps track of transfers, inferior to money? Why is fiat money Pareto superior to commodity money (gold, silver, etc.)? What causes inflation? What about banking - why do we need it? Are banks&nbsp;always welfare-improving? Why do banks fail?&nbsp;This course starts with a micro-founded approach to money using an overlapping generations model and discusses why money is not a constraint but an instrument that arises endogenously leading to welfare gains for the economy. Then we build on this model and go on to study the relationship between money and other institutions that issue/ use money - financial intermediation &amp; banks, a model of bank risk and bank panic (Diamond-Dybvig model).</p>\n\n<p>Time permitting and based on your collective interest &amp; my expertise, we might cover other interesting topics in monetary economics such as national debt, fiscal theories of price level &amp; inflation, pension systems,&nbsp;and/ or one or two&nbsp;MA/ Ph.D. level papers on money-related topics.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Components</strong></p>\n\n<p>Midterm 1: 20% weightage</p>\n\n<p><br />\nMidterm 2: 20% weightage</p>\n\n<p><br />\nHomework: 8% weightage</p>\n\n<p><br />\nPop Quizzes: 7% weightage</p>\n\n<p><br />\nFinal Exam: 35% weightage</p>\n\n<p><br />\nParticipation (including attendance): 10% weightage</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Points to note</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Pop quizzes are random&nbsp;quizzes (i.e. not pre-announced)&nbsp;that could be given&nbsp;on any lecture day. If you miss a pop quiz, you earn zero on that particular quiz. I will, however, drop&nbsp;1/4th (rounded up to the nearest integer)&nbsp;of your lowest pop quiz scores. For example, if there are a total of 6 pop quizzes, I will drop the lowest 2 scores. If there are 5 pop quizzes, I will drop the lowest 2 scores.&nbsp;If there are 4 pop quizzes, I will drop the lowest score.&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>If your score on the Final Exam is better than your lowest midterm, I&nbsp;am willing to drop your lowest midterm and scale up the score on the final exam by a factor of (35+20)/35 = 1.571 (approx)<br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Your Total Score will be calculated according to:<br />\n\tTotal Score = maximum of Method 1 Score and Method 2 Score rounded up to zero decimal places, where<br />\n\tMethod 1 Score = Midterm 1 + Midterm 2 + HW +&nbsp;Pop Quiz&nbsp;+ Participation + Final<br />\n\tMethod 2 Score = max(Midterm 1, Midterm 2) +&nbsp;HW + Pop Quiz + Participation + (55/35)*Final</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>How difficult is this course?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the last academic year median grade in this course was between B and B+. Median grade usually hovers in this zone; some cohorts are better than others and their median grade has&nbsp;been between B+ and&nbsp;A-. With regular and consistent efforts it is not difficult to get an A.

There are 26 scheduled lectures, of which 2 will be reserved for the two midterms. The class will effectively meet <strong>24</strong> <strong>times</strong> during the semester. If a student&rsquo;s lecture attendance <strong>falls below</strong> <strong>17 lectures (~ 71% of 24)</strong>, then the student will earn nothing&nbsp;on the Participation Grade (<strong>0 on 10% of the total course score</strong>). This almost certainly amounts to the difference between two consecutive letter grades, and in some cases between three consecutive letter grades.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I will be taking a <strong>roll call</strong> at the beginning of every class. If a&nbsp;student shows up after the roll call, they will be marked as &quot;absent&quot; for that particular lecture. This is what I mean by timely attendance.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Due to seminars, conferences, or other such scholarly&nbsp;engagements, I might be traveling for some days of the semester. If I am out of the station on a lecture day and unable to teach in person, I will make up for it either through an in-person lecture&nbsp;or an online lecture on a pre-agreed date or time. <strong>If I teach an online lecture, I will take note of the Zoom attendance log to determine your participation points.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, it is called Participation Grade so a student must not engage in anything that qualifies as non-participatory or disruptive behavior including (but not limited to) using laptops/ tablets/ cellphones for purposes not related to the course, sleeping in class, studying for another course in class, chit-chatting, leaving the lecture early without permission, etc. Non-participatory or disruptive behavior will lead to the cancellation of attendance points for that particular lecture.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>During the first couple of weeks (shopping weeks)</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>If you are attending my lectures without being enrolled in the course, make your presence known so that I can mark you as attended (even when your name isn&#39;t on the roster)</li>\n\t<li>If you miss the first couple of lectures and enroll in the course late, how will I calculate your attendance points? Ans: Just like anybody else&#39;s. The total&nbsp;number of lectures attended out of 24. If less than 17, zero on participation.</li>\n\t<li>During the shopping weeks, if&nbsp;you are contemplating whether or not to enroll in my course, given point 2 it would be best (for your sake) to attend the lectures and do as instructed in point 1.</li>\n</ol>\n</div></div>"

The starting point of these discussions will be a summary prepared by a group of students, and posted on Moodle.</p>\n\n<p>The summary should also include a list of questions or points to ponder, to engender discussion. As a rough guide, I expect a summary of about 150-200 words (excluding discussion points), and about 4-5 discussion points.</p>\n\n<p>The instructor will split students into groups of 2-3 members each, and assign them one or more readings to summarise. The summary is due at noon, two days in advance of the class in which it is to be discussed. Thus, the summary of the reading(s) to be discussed on Wednesdays are always due on Monday 12:00pm sharp, and for Fridays, are due on Thursday, 12:00pm sharp.</p>\n\n<p>Late submissions are costly for the entire class and will be heavily penalised.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Class Tests</strong></p>\n\n<p>Three class tests will be conducted during the semester.

Project groups will be created by the instructor. The project must involve empirical analysis using existing data from published sources.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Class discussions are central to the way we will all learn in this course. These discussions will occur in two ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>after the summary of a reading is posted on Moodle, students may post responses, or additional questions and/or discussion points on that reading. Only comments posted until 11:55pm on the night prior to the class will count towards the participation grade.</li>\n\t<li>during class meetings, we will have discussions on the readings, based on the summary, discussion points etc posted on Moodle. Students should expect to be cold-called by the instructor during class.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Class participation will be graded on a simple scale: 0 if you are absent, 1 if you are present, and 2 if you are present and actively participating. For the purposes of receiving a score of 2, active participation in the online discussion and active participation in the discussion in class will be treated as substitutes. However, absence from class will result in a score of 0 irrespective of your participation online.</p>\n\n<p>Grading is the sole prerogative of the Teaching Fellow and the instructor.</p>\n\n<p>Attendance will be taken in the first 5 minutes of a class meeting. If you are not present during that time, you will be marked absent for the day. Please make it a point to be punctual. The instructor reserves the right to mark you absent if you leave for a substantial part of the class after attendance is taken.</p>\n\n<p>Class participation will also be assessed in Discussion Section meetings.</p>\n\n<p>The number of assessment points for class participation are not pre-determined. The lowest 15% of such assessments (including absences) will be dropped in the computation of your final class participation grade.</p>\n\n<p>There is no concept of &quot;excused absences&quot;&nbsp;in this course, other than in exceptional cases of protracted illness, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Absence from more than eight class meetings at which class participation is assessed, will result in automatic failure in the course.</p>\n</div></div>"

The final weightage will be communicated after the first four weeks of the semester.</p>\n\n<p>Notwithstanding this calculation, absence from more than eight class meetings at which class participation is assessed, will result in automatic failure (grade F) in the course.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reading summaries</strong></p>\n\n<p>The primary method of learning in this course will be class discussions based on the readings. The starting point of these discussions will be a summary prepared by a group of students, and posted on Moodle.</p>\n\n<p>The summary should also include a list of questions or points to ponder, to engender discussion. As a rough guide, I expect a summary of about 150-200 words (excluding discussion points), and about 4-5 discussion points.</p>\n\n<p>The instructor will split students into groups of 2-3 members each, and assign them one or more readings to summarise. The summary is due at noon, two days in advance of the class in which it is to be discussed. Thus, the summary of the reading(s) to be discussed on Wednesdays are always due on Monday 12:00pm sharp, and for Fridays, are due on Thursday, 12:00pm sharp.</p>\n\n<p>Late submissions are costly for the entire class and will be heavily penalised.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Class Tests</strong></p>\n\n<p>Three class tests will be conducted during the semester. The tests will be held in discussion sections at various points of the semester.&nbsp;Each test will be closed-book and closed-notes, and will typically expect short answers on 4-5 questions. No make-up will be offered for a missed test.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Group Project</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each student must complete a research project over the semester, as part of a group with one other student. Project groups will be created by the instructor. The project must involve empirical analysis using existing data from published sources.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Class discussions are central to the way we will all learn in this course. These discussions will occur in two ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>after the summary of a reading is posted on Moodle, students may post responses, or additional questions and/or discussion points on that reading. Only comments posted until 11:55pm on the night prior to the class will count towards the participation grade.</li>\n\t<li>during class meetings, we will have discussions on the readings, based on the summary, discussion points etc posted on Moodle. Students should expect to be cold-called by the instructor during class.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Class participation will be graded on a simple scale: 0 if you are absent, 1 if you are present, and 2 if you are present and actively participating. For the purposes of receiving a score of 2, active participation in the online discussion and active participation in the discussion in class will be treated as substitutes. However, absence from class will result in a score of 0 irrespective of your participation online.</p>\n\n<p>Grading is the sole prerogative of the Teaching Fellow and the instructor.</p>\n\n<p>Attendance will be taken in the first 5 minutes of a class meeting. If you are not present during that time, you will be marked absent for the day. Please make it a point to be punctual. The instructor reserves the right to mark you absent if you leave for a substantial part of the class after attendance is taken.</p>\n\n<p>Class participation will also be assessed in Discussion Section meetings.</p>\n\n<p>The number of assessment points for class participation are not pre-determined. The lowest 15% of such assessments (including absences) will be dropped in the computation of your final class participation grade.</p>\n\n<p>There is no concept of &quot;excused absences&quot;&nbsp;in this course, other than in exceptional cases of protracted illness, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Absence from more than eight class meetings at which class participation is assessed, will result in automatic failure in the course.</p>\n</div></div>"

During paper presentations, you should ask reasonable questions based on the paper.</li>\n\t<li>Homeworks and Class Tests (35%): While teaching, I will at times skip some of the mathy details and simply present the results. It is your job to do all the math/ derivations/ diagrams and convince yourself of the results. Sometimes I will assign these &ldquo;filler&rdquo; derivations/ math/ diagrams as your homework.

What this course seeks to explore is why the study of literature needs &lsquo;theory&rsquo; in all its various guises. What kind of relation does literature have with theory that is manifestly different, and indeed incompatible with, the traditional understanding of object and knowledge in philosophy and the sciences? The advent of &lsquo;theory&rsquo; (as contrasted with &lsquo;philosophy&rsquo; and &lsquo;science&rsquo;) has to be seen, not just as the beginning of a radical critique of the purportedly self-evident notions of subject, class, caste, race, gender and identity but also as a revolution in the very concepts of knowledge, truth and reality themselves. What happens to these concepts when literature (which has for so long been the catch-all term for illusion, falsity, imitation and error) becomes the site of truth; when theory replaces philosophy?</p>\n\n<p>This course seeks to enter into these questions raised by literary theory.

In this class we shall examine literary and real examples of how the human imagination steps in to promise (and sometimes deliver) moments of heightened intensity that address reality&rsquo;s limitations. This&nbsp;class provides an introduction to the devices of the imagination--dreams, pictures, and fantasy laden objects--that allow human&nbsp;beings to adapt to reality. Drawing from the theories of psychoanalysis, and the experiences of&nbsp;literary characters, we will attempt to understand how humans invest imagined meanings and denied aspects of the self into other&nbsp;people and into objects.&nbsp;As we travel through the terrains of the real and the imagined, we will address important questions about how these two realms relate to each other. Why do the real and the imaginary sometimes live in an antagonistic relationship within the psyche? What happens when the imagination appropriates the psyche to exclude the real? How do literary characters invest people and objects with imagined meanings and denied aspects of the self? How has humans&#39; investment in physical reality changed with the birth of virtual reality? Theory texts include Lionel Trilling, Sigmund Freud, Masud Khan, D.W. Winnicott and Adam Phillips.

Artificial intelligence is going to drive this change. We are already feeling the impact of AI in several products and services that we use almost daily. For example, Google uses an AI tool to selectively show us advertisements. The income tax department is using A.I. with business intelligence to identify people who have not been paying taxes. The world of medicine is undergoing changes with A.I. being used to identify cancerous cells. Companies are looking to hire data analysts and scientist who can create novel products and solve complex problems. The acute shortage of skilled manpower is being felt globally. Therefore, providing undergraduate students with skills in artificial intelligence and business insights is the need of the hour.

An example of this is algorithmic trading where an algorithm uses trading data to determine when you should buy or sell a stock in the market. It becomes more interesting when the income tax department assess a lot of data about individual taxpayers and determines that some of the citizens are not paying enough in taxes. The third example is based on the idea of who should be given a credit card. Most people who have high savings qualify for a credit card but what about those people who have low to medium savings. What about students at Ashoka? Many of these decisions in finance, such as selling a stock, obtaining a credit card, and identifying defaulters, are based on technology, mathematical algorithms, and knowledge of finance. A person who masters these 3 fields can work for large companies, set-up their own start-up, trade in the markets, pursue a career in research, become a financial consultant and pursue many more opportunities than what is mentioned here. The course starts with a brief understanding of markets and data that we can obtain for these markets. Then we look at how to use this data to decide if we should buy or sell a stock or bond. After having evaluated it heuristically we try to explore algorithms that can fit the behaviour of the data and perhaps indicate the buy and sell decision. Similarly, we apply this broad principle of identifying the data, examining it and then determining which model should be fitted to different problems in finance including predicting stock price, detecting fraud, providing credit, pricing options, sizing of companies based on financial attributes. Companies worldwide are looking for talented people who can understand different parts of finance and apply the right tools and techniques to analyze the products, customers and services. Our goal is to provide students an opportunity to learn these skills and see challenging careers in finance globally. It is oriented towards undergraduates who may not necessarily have coding skills.

Its origins can be traced back to the 1980s, primarily among Black communities in the United States. It also encompasses a pivotal reshaping of the American landscape after World War II, which involved state-endorsed racial discrimination and segregation against people of color. This discrimination manifested in various aspects, such as housing, workplaces, the placement of hazardous and polluting factories, as well as the disposal of toxic wastes. Environmental historians have pointed out that the first national People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit, held in Washington DC in October 1991, represented a historic moment in the environmental justice movement. Social justice has found frequent mention in the vocabulary of environmental justice.</p>\n\n<p>Environmental justice concept and activism have been grounded locally; at the same time, it has continued to evolve globally. Not only has its initial perspective been anchored in bourgeoning thinking about the interconnectedness of environmental justice with &ldquo;different cultural and political histories&rdquo; and &ldquo;the rejection of any form of racism, discrimination and oppression,&rdquo; it also has had good traction in different continents around broader concepts of justice. Horizontal and vertical globalizing of environmental justice has found echoes in different countries and continents, including India. Going beyond national borders, its concerns have encompassed trade agreements, transfer of wastes, climate change, and the Rights of Nature. The &ldquo;new pluralism&rdquo; of environmental justice, which offers ways to include diversity, difference, recognition, and participation, for unpacking histories and geographies of exclusion, refers to development-induced displacement, gender and caste-based discrimination in accessing natural resources.</p>\n\n<p>Through historical and comparative perspectives, which encompass gender and class, environmental authors in India have argued that varieties of environmentalism in South Asia originate in social conflicts and justice issues over access to and control over natural resources&mdash;for example, conflicts between peasants and industry over forest produce; rural and urban populations over water and energy; or struggles of the poor against corporates, markets, and state to retain their control over natural resources.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The course is organized around weekly lectures and discussions based on the readings.

Students will be initiated into learning Persian language and literature from learning alphabet to formation of words and sentences in Persian. Learning materials will be provided by the course instructor. Weekly class room activities are given below:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Persian Alphabet and Script</strong></p>\n\n<p>Persian alphabet consists of 32 letters which are written from right to left. It is a Perso-Arabic script. Students will be taught to write the alphabet. The letters are to be written separately and jointly in which they will change forms.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Formation of Words</strong></p>\n\n<p>Once the students learn alphabet and script, they will easily use them to form words which is the first step towards learning a language. Besides, they will be introduced to short and long Persian vowels. Separate letters will be given to the students to join them and form words. They must make 100 Persian words from the given letters. Pronunciation and meaning of every word will be explained to them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Numbers, Names of Days of the week, Months and Seasons</strong></p>\n\n<p>Persian numbers are written from left to right in similar way as in English. In this class students will learn to write Persian cardinals and ordinals with proper pronunciation. Further, it will help them to learn the names of days of the week in Persian easily. Students will also learn the names of months and seasons. They will learn to use the numerical also to denote singular and plural noun.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Possessive Case and Usage of Noun with Adjectives</strong></p>\n\n<p>In Persian language personal pronoun plays an important role. It has both long and short form which help learner to identify the subject/object in a sentence. In this class students will be taught to form or connect noun with adjective and noun with noun. Usage of link (Ezafe) will be taught to the learners to form possessive case or to connect noun with noun and adjective with noun to describe the noun. Students will also learn to use positive comparative and superlative degrees of adjective. List of adjectives will be provided to them in order to build their vocabulary, clauses and expressions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Infinitives and Conjugation of Tenses</strong></p>\n\n<p>Grammar or the science of language is essential to learn a language in an easy and systematic way. Persian grammar is limited and easy to learn. It has etymology (sarf) and syntax (nahv) which help the learners to identify words and write sentences grammatically correct. Persian grammar begins with infinitive (masdar) which is considered as &ldquo;mother of words&rdquo;. Infinitive begets different forms of a word. They also enable to form tenses- Present, Past and Future. The verbs also correspond with subject. Therefore, verbs and nouns will be taught together and in this way etymology and syntax will go hand in hand.</p>\n\n<p>In this class students will learn to form past tense in Persian. All the types of past tense are formed by a simple manner and easy to learn method. Persian infinitives (masadir) provide forms of past tenses. Students will be provided with a list of infinitives (masadir) in the class and their meaning will be explained to them. They will have to memorize the infinitives (masadir) which will help them to form sentences in various past tenses.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Conjugating Present Tense</strong></p>\n\n<p>Present tense in Persian is formed by using the present stem of verb deduced from&nbsp;&nbsp; an infinitive. In this class students will learn to form the present stem from Persian infinitives which help them to form sentences in present tense.</p>\n\n<p>They will be provided with a list of present stems from Persian infinitives. They will memorize them to develop their skill to form sentences in present tense in Persian. The present tenses are simple present and present continuous tense only which are used to convey proverbial, universal and general matters of fact.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conjugating Future Tense</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this class students will learn to form sentences in future tense. In Persian language there are two types of future tense. Present continuous tense is also used to express future act. However, there is a particular method or usage of word to denote future tense. Students will be taught to use both the forms of future tense in the class and their appropriate usages.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Interrogative, Affirmative, Negative, Interjection and Conjunction</strong></p>\n\n<p>After learning the three forms of tenses of Persian language students will be able to form sentences in various tenses. In this class they will learn to make interrogative sentences in Persian. Students will learn to make the sentences by using different interrogative words. They will also learn to change affirmative sentences into negative. Interjection and conjunction make a sentence expressive and cohesive. A list of words (interjection and conjunction) will be given to the students to use them in their sentences.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Persian Adverbs</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this class students will become familiar with the different types of adverb used in Persian language. Adverb of time, place and manner will be used by the students to form sentences.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Persian Prepositions</strong></p>\n\n<p>The link (ezafe) that has been taught in previous class joins two words together. However, there is a list of prepositions in Persian language. Prepositions are necessary to learn in order to make their appropriate usage in sentences. Their usages will make expressions meaningful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Auxiliary Verbs</strong></p>\n\n<p>Besides learning the main verbs, it is expedient for the learners to know and use auxiliary verbs in Persian. They are an added advantage to a sentence to express ideas in a whole some manner. They are used along with the main verb in a grammatical template. The template will be explained to the students to use auxiliary verbs in a sentence in past, present and future tenses.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Persian Proverbs and Idioms</strong></p>\n\n<p>Proverbs are the condensed form of human wisdom expressed in crisp and clear words in society. Idioms are the way of expression in a language. Proverbs and idioms make a language beautiful, graceful and meaningful. Students will learn</p>\n\n<p>at least 10 to 15 Persian proverbs and 20-25 idioms that will help to develop their linguistic skill.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Composition</strong></p>\n\n<p>Composition, pr&eacute;cis writing and essay help a language learner to express himself in his language. Texts will be provided to the students to comprehend and respond to them and make a precis of them. They will be asked write essays on topic of their choice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reading and Translating Persian Text</strong></p>\n\n<p>After learning the basic grammar, students will start reading the Persian texts both poetry and prose. They will be able to translate them into English. Students will be provided easy and simple Persian texts to read and translate them into English. They will improve their reading and comprehension abilities. They will also be encouraged to use Persian dictionary to translate the given texts. In order to develop proficiency in language reading Persian texts and translating them into English on daily basis are recommended. This exercise of reading and translating Persian texts will continue for next five weeks. Different texts will be provided to the students every week to read, comprehend and translate them. To begin with, a poetic text of Nizami Ganjavi will be studied in the class which is simple and easy to understand. It is a hymn written in beautiful and elegant Persian. Text of Nizami&rsquo;s hymn is titled: Be Naam-i-Izad Bakshayendeh (In the Name of God the Merciful) compiled in Farsi wa Dastur by Zahra Khanleri will be provided to the students.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>At the end of the course students will have a basic understanding of the Persian language and they will be able to read, write and understand basic Persian texts</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Materilas will be provided in the class</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Three Monthly Tests of 25 Marks each (Marks of the best two shall be considered for the final grading)</p>\n\n<p>Final End Semester Exam of 50 Marks</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Not more than 2 Abscences allowed&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>"

But Jainism (along with Buddhism) began as one of the most successful heterodox movements that challenged Vedic orthodoxy and initiated&nbsp;the oldest&nbsp;renunciatory&nbsp;traditions in India in 6th century BCE. This course&nbsp;undertakes a broad survey of the roughly 2,5000 year-old&nbsp;history&nbsp;of Jainism, highlighting its key precepts and practices. Some of the exciting questions that&nbsp;will&nbsp;be investigated are as follows: How are Buddhist and Jaina philosophies similar to yet different from each other? What is the philosophical underpinning of the defining&nbsp;Jaina principle of non-violence (<em>ahimsa)</em>? What explains the sustained worship of Jaina scriptures and the maintenance of Jaina libraries (<em>bhandara</em>s)? What is the&nbsp;history&nbsp;of Jaina interface with other religious traditions such as Śaivism and Islam? What are the legal implications of competing claims over Jaina sacred sites and the Jaina practice of fasting unto death in contemporary India? For students of&nbsp;history, reading the 17th century autobiography of a Jaina merchant, which is the first autobiography in an Indian language, is likely to be a memorable experience.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>1.

It introduces them to several key theoretical perspectives and concepts of IR and encourages them to apply these to contemporary issues of international politics. The course begins by studying mainstream theoretical approaches (realism, liberalism, and constructivism), touching on their political- philosophical foundations and how these evolved into becoming a distinct branch of political science in the twentieth century. It then covers the subdiscipline of International Political Economy (IPE) and thinking about ethics in IR that the dominant theories have produced. Turning to more reflective approaches, the course discusses the need to &lsquo;globalize&rsquo; or &lsquo;decolonialize&rsquo; IR, as well as feminist contributions to the study of international relations. Students will learn how each of the theoretical perspectives and approaches provides for a distinctive way of understanding the relations between states and other international actors. In terms of application of the theories, the course encourages students to apply their obtained theoretical knowledge to the pertinent issues of war, the environment, humanitarian intervention, and nuclear proliferation, weighing and evaluating the contributions that the different perspectives make to our understanding of each of these topics.</p>\n\n<p>Students who have already completed IR-1008 &lsquo;Theories and Issues of International Relations&rsquo; should not enroll in this course. IR-1009 is a revised version of IR-1008 aimed at students who are entirely new to the discipline of International Relations.

Logic is concerned with truth; in learning it, we learn to evaluate how well our thoughts and arguments are tied to truth. We will study several articial&nbsp;formal languages, especially rst-order propositional and predicate logic, as well as modal and higher-order logic. We will think about their relation to the&nbsp;natural language&nbsp;of English, and to the world, as it is independent of all our speech.</p>\n\n<p>This is a demanding course, covering a good deal of challenging technical ground. It is still an introductory course, intended primarily to prepare philosophers for work across that subject. It is not an advanced course, exploring the field of logic for its own sake, in the manner of an advanced metaphysics course. But as an introductory logic course, it is more advanced than most (including, for instance, the logic course offered by the excellent department at Leeds, in Britain&rsquo;s prestigious Russell Group). Some of the topics covered towards the end are at the edge of active research. You will have to work hard, and you may well feel yourself struggling at times.

Using these methodologies, which he dubbed &lsquo;archaeology&rsquo; and &lsquo;genealogy&rsquo;, he examined histories of madness, medicine, criminality, sexuality, and governmentality. He also examined the epistemological relations among sets of social sciences (economics, biology, linguistics and philosophy) across a major epistemological break (from the &lsquo;classical age&rsquo; to &lsquo;modernity&rsquo;). In doing so he identified ongoing antinomies in modern social sciences, which threaten their coherence. At the heart of his investigations of systems of thought lie questions regarding the production of knowledge, structures of power, the meaning of ethics and the possibility of freedom. He builds on the work of Kant, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche and Heidegger to create an astonishing set of tools for analysing knowledge, power, and the subject (of power, ethics and freedom). This course will give an overview of Foucault&rsquo;s work, with a focus on the concepts of knowledge, power and the subject.</p>\n</div></div>"

Armed Conflicts in India [POL-2091] [POL-2091-1]</h4><div><strong>Faculty Name </strong><div class='cmsDescp'>Kaustav Dhar Chakrabarti [kaustav.chakrabarti@ashoka.edu.in] ;</div></div><div><strong>Overview</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>&ldquo;One person&rsquo;s freedom fighter is another person&rsquo;s terrorist&rdquo; is a common expression that sums up the complexity of armed conflicts around the world. How should we understand the state&rsquo;s claims to legitimacy versus some of our most cherished beliefs in civil rights and the right to self-determination? This course will approach the question through the lens of theories in political science while being grounded in the empirical realities of armed conflicts across India. The course does not take a normative position on these conflicts &ndash; we will not assume that armed groups are &lsquo;unlawful&rsquo;, neither will we valorise them. We will treat armed conflicts as a political phenomenon of interest, and I invite you to use the course to sharpen and test your prior views.</p>\n\n<p>The course will cover five major themes on armed conflicts. We will begin with establishing a solid conceptual foundation &ndash; What are armed conflicts? How are they different from other forms of organized violence? What are armed groups? Next, we will examine the causes of armed conflicts. Are conflicts rooted in political and economic grievances? Or should we blame self-interested leaders?</p>\n\n<p>In the second module, we will study how combat, or war-fighting differs between civil wars and conventional interstate war. We will explore how armed groups organize for war (the lessons of Mao, Irish Republican Army) and how India responds and read counterinsurgency doctrine and examine the effect of &lsquo;hearts and minds&rsquo; development programs. The third module covers arguably the core of guerrilla warfare &ndash; armed groups&rsquo; relations with the community. We will examine how armed groups mobilize support, the depth of their connections with the community and their treatment of civilians, and the methods that they adopt to solicit the community&rsquo;s support. We will also cover the terrain of pre-existing social institutions and the community&rsquo;s experience with the incumbent state and examine how it affects its decision to support (or withhold support) to armed groups.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The fourth modules returns to aspects of armed groups where we will study how commitment to ideology, and robust centralized organization to ensure discipline among cadre, and splintering into factions,&nbsp; affects the behaviour of armed groups.</p>\n\n<p>The final module covers the role of external factors &ndash; foreign bases in inaccessible forests of Myanmar, support from China and Pakistan, the role of diaspora, and ask if the presence of &lsquo;foreign fighters&rsquo; should change our understanding. The course culminates with the important theme of conflict resolution; why did military methods succeed in Punjab but not in Kashmir? Why did negotiations succeed in Mizoram but have failed to resolve the dispute in Nagaland?&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The goals of the course are three-fold. By the end of the course, students should have an overview of some of the major debates in the political science of civil war, especially those that are pertinent to India. In addition, the course will familiarise students with major civil wars (or &lsquo;insurgencies&rsquo;) in India through detailed case studies. Finally, the course will reinforce the department&rsquo;s continuous training in analytical thinking. It will bolster students&rsquo; ability to distinguish between different theoretical explanations, evaluate the merit of competing arguments made in the literature, and communicate their arguments clearly in written form. &nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>To be shared soon.&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Course will not grade on a scale.&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Your participation is essential for the course&rsquo;s success and you are expected to attend all lectures.

The course will offer a sweeping review of collective action by communities &ndash; villages caught between rebels and military as they collectively deliberate over whom to support, economic migrants in foreign soil who use informal networks to send money &lsquo;back home&rsquo;, neighbourhood groups who organise collective petitions to force the government to hear their demands, ethnic groups in conflict who mobilise for peace and reconciliation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Consider the following examples. In rural China, Lilly Tsai tells us, state officials embedded into temple networks of their home villages refrain from demanding bribes. In the absence of democratic institutions of accountability, temple leaders, on behalf of the community, reward upright officials with higher social standing. In Afghanistan, villages with strong councils (<em>jirga</em>) organise more successfully to ward off predatory behaviour from distant state officials. Similarly, communities organise for, but also against, rebel groups. In Mizoram, regions where villages were strongly interconnected through rotating church pastors witnessed greater rebel recruitment;&nbsp;the frequent exchange of information between well-connected villages reassured rebels that their secrets will not be leaked to security forces. In Colombia, in contrast, indigenous communities mobilised against FARC rebels. The ability of a community to organise collectively affects outcomes as varied as riots, prison violence, and the inner workings of the Sicilian Mafia. At the broadest scale, to echo Robert Putnam&rsquo;s celebrated work on Italy, robust connections across otherwise disparate communities enhances social capital, which in turn, &lsquo;makes democracy work&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>These anecdotes barely touch the surface of the critical role of community ties and networks in a diverse range of political phenomena &ndash; accountability, economic exchange (we will study how Hawala transactions work), civil war resistance, democracy, riots, and organised crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In order to understand communities and collective action, the course will survey both classical and contemporary exemplars from across the social science (admittedly with a strong focus on political science). We will begin with a thorough baseline understanding of the concept of collective action &ndash; why do groups struggle to organise toward a goal that each member desires and will benefit from? What are some of the well-known solutions to collective action problem?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Building upon this foundation, we will delve deeper into specific instances of collective action. To cite a few, we will study how closely-knit social networks (imagine a village where &lsquo;everyone knows everyone&rsquo;) can monitor their members (peer monitoring, in-group policing). We will uncover the nebulous concept of &lsquo;trust&rsquo;, that allows individuals to anticipate that their peers will honour their word when rational calculations should suggest otherwise. Of course, a course like this will remain incomplete without engaging with norms of reciprocity, solidarity and altruism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>By the end of the course, students should have a sound overview of some of the major debates surrounding collective action by communities. It will also reinforce the department&rsquo;s continuous training in analytical thinking. It will bolster students&rsquo; ability to distinguish between different theoretical explanations, evaluate the merit of competing arguments made in the literature, and communicate their arguments clearly in written form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This is a senior-level course and will follow the seminar format. In each meeting, I will frame the discussion and raise a few questions. I expect you to come prepared with summaries, thought-provoking questions and comments.

How do entrepreneurs raise funds, create a team and get their venture off the ground? Are there any key ingredients of a successful start-up? </strong></p>\n\n<p>These, and other similar questions, will be a part of Venture Planning &amp; Strategy. The course is organized around modules. After introducing the case study method (that forms the basis of course instruction through the term) the first two sessions will engage with personal dilemmas that entrepreneurs confront in the initial phases of their start-up. The role of entrepreneurial vision and the hopes &amp; aspirations of first-generation entrepreneurs will be debated. Sessions 3 &amp; 4 introduce the business model canvas (BMC) and the lean start-up methodology to understand the importance of rapid prototyping and the need of a minimum viable product (MVP). The key learning is the ability to rapidly prototype and has an MVP at the lowest cost and in the quickest time so that entrepreneurs can pivot on their initial ideas. In sessions 5 &amp; 6 students will engage with industry analysis. They will learn a variety of frameworks and learn how to conduct an external industry analysis like strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats (SWOT), examine political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal factors (PESTEL) and use Porter Five Force to evaluate the attractiveness of an industry. Sessions 7 &amp; 8 introduce the concept of a Blue Ocean Strategy. Firms traditionally compete in red oceans which are crowded marketplaces where new entrants take market share from existing players. Over a period, this ends up being a zero-sum game. However, some entrepreneurial firms are able to create new opportunities by differentiating themselves and offering customers a new value innovation. How do they do it and what can we learn from it? Sessions 9&amp;10 will analyze the financial and legal aspects of a startup. Financing options include bank loans, social media campaigns, venture funding, crowdfunding etc.. We will also discuss the advantages and pitfalls accompanying each of them. Sessions 11 will be devoted to understanding the entrepreneurial context in large firms where firms want their employees to be &lsquo;intrapreneurs&rsquo;. Firms increasingly seek to disrupt themselves through corporate innovation rather than wait for smaller start-ups to upend their business model. This will also introduce the concept of a hackathon where teams work on collaborative projects to produce a working prototype. The final sessions 12 &amp; 13 will be devoted to student presentations on a business plan that they have been working on in groups through the term.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/3757b883-2c4d-4396-8c31-8561526e8057.pdf' download='Venture Planning _ Strategy - Mukesh Sud (2).pdf'>Venture Planning _ Strategy - Mukesh Sud (2).pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>"

For students who are considering becoming entrepreneurs in the very near-future, this course would be like a &lsquo;<em>finishing schoo</em>l&rsquo;. Whereas, students who want to work in the corporate sector or at startups, will acquire the foundational skills t<em>o be successful intrapreneurs driving innovation in these companies.</em></p>\n\n<p>It would be <strong><em>a fast-paced and immersive experience of the entire entrepreneurial journey from Idea to MVP</em></strong>. Besides the product and commercial aspects that are important while creating new ventures, several classes will be devoted to helping students become &lsquo;<em>Contemplative Entrepreneurs</em>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>Doing it Right</em>&rsquo;. &lsquo;Contemplative entrepreneurs&rsquo; are trained to ask critical questions on a timely basis, rather than take decisions on the fly. This ensures that they make fewer mistakes. &lsquo;Doing it Right&rsquo; means not giving a short shrift to the ethics and governance aspects of business leadership. The world around is replete with examples of high-profile entrepreneurs who have gone astray on this count.</p>\n\n<p>I will begin by helping students sharpen their &lsquo;<em>Problem Statement&rsquo;</em>, and then do disruptive ideation that will be validated through &lsquo;<em>Voice of the Customer</em>&rsquo;. Thereafter, developing <em>a product strategy</em> (incl. <em>designing and executing a MVP</em>) will be a big part of the learning. Students will also learn <em>key business concepts</em> (e.g. business models, moats, go-to-market frameworks &amp; performance metrics) and incorporate them into their own venture. At a mid-point of the course, students will do <em>field visits to meet a set of startup founders in NCR</em>, and also meet some <em>domain mentors</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, students will develop their investor pitches using structured frameworks as well as compelling storytelling techniques. <em><strong>The culmination of this Startup Grand Challenge will be a &lsquo;Demo Day&rsquo; where students will pitch to a panel of investors and mentors.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>This hands-on bootcamp-style course &nbsp;intertwines theory &amp; practice so that students learn key concepts of new venture creation while simultaneously putting them in practice.

One of the strongest tools in the arsenal of media professionals, sound has the ability to construct, amplify and create more dynamic narratives, while engaging subliminally. Whether it is in the form of music or sound design, sound art or spoken word. This course is an audio literacy primer.</p>\n\n<p>In this course over three months, we will deconstruct sound and explore the building blocks of audio from the lens of its Nature, Behaviour and Interaction. We will break it down to its key components of physics, its interaction with space and different mediums, its translation and the listener&rsquo;s interpretation of this engagement. This will guide us through the levels of intervention that can be done in pre and post production through Digital Audio Workstations (DAW) to construct and curate the steps in the processing of sound. These techniques of bending sound can be applied to all forms of sound in various media; be it podcasting, audiobooks, music production, sound design and sound art. A course which introduces nature, behaviour and our interaction with sound through multiple audio forms and ways of listening.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Learning Outcome: A strong foundation in understanding the key components of sound. Including developing the ability to visualise and interpret how sound interacts with different acoustic environments.</p>\n\n<p>Identify the skills to record and manipulate this, applying post production techniques of processing audio, assessing the contrast and tweaking the audio. Both while capturing it and in post-production; to narrow the differences for more coherence and continuity in the program material.</p>\n\n<p>The students will be able to assess the merits between different microphones, make informed choices on equipment and techniques of recording.</p>\n\n<p>Get a firm grasp on navigating DAWs and be able to work with multitrack audio. They will be able to tweak multitrack audio with regard to the final delivery medium.</p>\n\n<p>Engage with sound using processing tools with a focus on the sound&rsquo;s emotional contour and context. They will develop the foundation for the skills needed to ensure that the program material translates and sounds as intended across different playback systems.</p>\n\n<p>Compile in the form of an audio story / podcast (fiction or nonfiction) with stock music and SFX and render it for release with industry standard audio specs.</p>\n</div></div>"

The course will include India specific case studies and sharing of experiences of successful investors and entrepreneurs. It covers several industries incl Real Estate, Fin Tech, Social enterprises, and Ecommerce.<br />\nThe course is based on the fundamental premise that the personal life &amp; career of every individual is also one of an investor and entrepreneur (everyone has to have an entrepreneur mindset whether salaried or an entrepreneur). Students can apply the same investment principles when taking decisions in professional life &ndash; incl. when they decide their career choices (where to invest the time capital of life). And that their professional journey post-graduation on the 4 pillars of any investment: Risk-Return &ndash;Investment-Mindset will mirror the life cycle of any enterprise from a startup (risk seeking) to VC to PE (more conservative) to finally being a Listed company where employers will sell and exit if they do not perform (with multiple turnarounds on the journey).<br />\nWhile this course uses the field of unlisted investments as an anchor, the paramount learning outcome it seeks to deliver to help the participant build a muscle of identifying and having courage to a) admitting about matters we think we don&rsquo;t know b) identify the matters which are important for you and your success in life and c) building a mental process to go out and understand them and learn.

This has been equally matched by shifting young adult preferences, especially from socially conscious and economically secure backgrounds, who are looking for opportunities to enhance their social contribution through their professional lives. The opportunities to affect social change have therefore grown exponentially &ndash; in the form of public sector fellowships, lateral entries into government, social sector/not for profit roles, research and think-tanks, entrepreneurship and start-ups, as well areas like social sector consulting and impact investing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>However, even as the inputs (people as well as money) increase manifold into this space, the improvement in outcomes is much slower. </strong>The quality of public-sector school education remains poor and successive NAS/ASER reports do not indicate a secular upward trend; even over decades. Public health systems still provide for only 30% of India&rsquo;s population with 70% people paying out of pocket for healthcare needs. Metrics like IMR/MMR/immunization rates or stunting are barely moving. Despite increasing subsidies and numerous programs, agriculture that engages 45% of India&rsquo;s workforce, it is not remunerative and holds limited attraction for youth as a talent pool. The average monthly income per agricultural household is just ₹10,218 with just 4-5% annual growth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where does this dichotomy of increased inputs and yet stagnant outcomes come from?</strong> Why do entrepreneurial innovations typically not scale and lead to transformative outcomes? What structural factors lie at the heart of it? How can those who are looking to enter this space understand and begin to tackle this dichotomy from day 1? We hope that this course will help you answer some of these essential questions and better prepare you for a professional career that interacts with this space in any shape or form.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/fc7c9a80-2e68-4eb3-94b0-457b38a533ef.pdf' download='Deconstructing Social Sector Systems.pdf'>Deconstructing Social Sector Systems.pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>"

It brings the perspective, &ldquo;People + Planet = Profit&rdquo; [often referred to as the triple bottom line] to the centerstage, which is a refreshing contrast to the predominant view imbibed by students, especially in business schools that the purpose of a business is profit maximization; all else only facilitates this pursuit.</p>\n\n<p>The world is in a state that can best be described as &ldquo;PLANETARY EMERGENCY.&rdquo; Signals pointing to this are visible to all of us everywhere, to see. Each of us is witnessing the tragic fallout of this perspective, with climate change set to disrupt all known goal posts. For example, typically, Delhi during end of March each year records peak temperatures in the mid-30 degrees Celsius. The year, 2022 was the hottest in 121 years of the history of recorded temperatures in India, with temperatures exceeding 41 degrees Celsius by March 27!</p>\n\n<p>Even in &lsquo;advanced countries&rsquo; such as the USA, companies and the public typically give&nbsp;&quot;lip service&quot; to environmental issues.&nbsp; Everyone is in favor of it until they have to pay for it.&nbsp; On the ground however, we do not see much progress on these issues until it&#39;s economically beneficial to save the environment.&nbsp;It appears to be all about the money!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So, when it comes to advocating these issues, one must emphasize the cost savings first and then double back and talk about how it will save the environment (i.e., economics before environment).&nbsp; Hence, to succeed in the efforts to address the looming challenges, one should&nbsp;start by talking about economic&nbsp;&quot;Customer Value Assessment&quot; before one tackles specific environmental issues.&nbsp; That&#39;s the winning formula. This is where the marketing angle of the issue of fostering a sustainable planet takes precedence. However, as can be recognized, it is not just about marketing!</p>\n\n<p>The course, &lsquo;Entrepreneurship and Climate Change&rsquo; [EACC] discusses the issues relating to sustainability from the perspective of businesses and the firm, and hence touches all aspects of the functioning of a firm, including its business, strategy, finance, operations, and much more. It thus takes an integrative approach, and fits in well with an elective course offering provided towards the final terms of any good undergraduate program. The course will equip students to prepare for the world that is fast unfolding before us, and help their companies to prosper, while doing good to the planet earth.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/293dca5b-6599-4b36-8f3c-62703273b48d.docx' download='ESCA.Ashoka University.Course Outline.Version 3.08.09.23.docx'>ESCA.Ashoka University.Course Outline.Version 3.08.09.23.docx</a></td></tr></table></div></div>"

However, we will drop the lowest assignment score during final evaluation. You will be evaluated based on how structured and meticulous you are, not the experimental results. We will also consider your critical abilities (e.g. strength and weakness of experimental methods, future direction) while writing the report.</p>\n\n<p>Final project (35%): Students will formulate a hypothesis that tests a natural law of their choice, devise an experiment to test the hypothesis, conduct the experiment, analyse the data and write a final report. They will also present their project in the last week of class. 10% of the grade will depend on peer grading by fellow students. Grades depend on originality, critical thinking, thoroughness and implications of research.&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Attendance is mandatory.

Migration is not a choice they make, it is a necessity, the only way to eat, to repay debts, to fund schooling and more. How do we tell their stories, and how are they represented in the media? Learning how to report on migration will lay the ground for future reporting on the dispossessed, the disenfranchised and the marginalised.&nbsp;We will be bringing in P. Sainath, Founder Editor of PARI who has written extensively on migration, to do a masterclass&nbsp;on migration journalism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This course will open a conversation on migrant labour, identifying the issues they face, the policies that help or fail them, the stories of their lives and livelihoods.

In these times visual storytelling is making a strong space for itself in every form of information or content. Be it journalism, health information, economics or plain fiction, the visual approach is now here to stay, in an age where the best of storytelling, poetry, journalism or reportage are now visually led.</p>\n\n<p>Visual Storytelling is an ever-evolving medium. From the cave drawings documenting the hunter&rsquo;s life or the Egyptian clay tablets that documented the Pharaoh&rsquo;s philosophy or the Persian miniatures that visually documented the Ruler&rsquo;s court or the wars, the Pahadi miniatures that visually articulated the leelas of Radha Krishna to the visual documentation in the modern era, from the peasant sketches of Van Gogh, the daily life depicted by Seurat, Degas and more or the nightlife by Lautrec, the Mexican muralists like Deigo Rivera, Orzoco, Chittoprasad, Indian artists like Ram Kinkar Baij, Somenath Hore to the best graphic narratives of our times by Chris Ware, Satrapi, Joe Sacco and now to the world of You Tube and Tik Tok animations the form has only grown both in terms of practice but also viewership and acceptance. In the visual world we live now, it is a form with a moving language now blending with technology. This course will blend these influences into ones&rsquo; own practice to create comics and graphic narratives in sync with the practitioner&rsquo;s area of interest and discipline.</p>\n\n<p>This is not to say that all human centric works of art can be categorized as narrative artworks but graphic narratives have grown and imbibed many of these experiences in the making of graphic stories including films and popular culture. For a medium as absorbent as graphic storytelling, the form has drawn inspiration and acknowledged the same from multiple disciplines like painting, prose and poetry, filmmaking and even gaming. It&rsquo;s this multi-disciplinary influence and framework this course seeks to work with.</p>\n\n<p>Graphic narratives can never be limited to a category but more than a form it has evolved to a medium that has embraced every subject which makes it a complete storytelling tool than an only entertainment or an informational one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This course seeks to engage with this fast-moving genre of visual storytelling through comics and graphic narratives with a research led and inter-disciplinary approach, in sync with the student&rsquo;s core area of interest or discipline.</p>\n\n<p><u>What this course is about</u></p>\n\n<p>In sync with the time&rsquo;s media or information dissemination, it is important to learn and practice visual storytelling as both a language and a medium that can be incorporated in one&rsquo;s individual academic discipline. This approach can help the students in articulating their learnings, research and storytelling in multi-disciplinary formats that is much required in today&rsquo;s realm of information &amp; content, where visual storytelling is an alternate and a popular form of information, opinion and communication.</p>\n\n<p><u>Learning Objectives:</u></p>\n\n<p>The semester will be a sequential flow from the history of visual documentation and articulation to the modern practices of graphic novels, mobile cartoons, comic strips and now visual narratives on the mobile to a practice- based approach.</p>\n\n<p>In the fast-moving visual world, students will learn to negotiate between the visuals and the written word in the process of crafting their individual narratives. The students will also explore and practice the modes and methods of visual storytelling through their chosen styles and influences. The expected outcome for the students will be practice based learning to develop their visual storytelling language, exploring the fluid connections between fact and fiction.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Learning Outcomes:</p>\n\n<p>The preliminary module of this course of 2 weeks will be a curated overview of the published, popular and the prevalent and emerging forms of visual storytelling in the world of graphic narratives and visuals. The idea would be exploring the diversity of practice across the globe and the processes involved in the making. The core idea here will be to discuss the forms and works to bring new practice-based influences and ideas, their working process and explore the architecture of visual storytelling in these works.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 1-2: Discuss works of art, graphic novels, cartoons, comic strips and create short narratives.</p>\n\n<p>This will be a presentation and discussion-based approach discussing the presented works in detail and the stories behind making many of these works. The idea will be to discuss the journey of the works from the intent to execution and the struggles and transformations that make the narrative in the final output. For example, Van Gogh&rsquo;s study of the peasantry, the sketch book notes leading to the potato eaters or Somenath Hore&rsquo;s diaries documenting the Tebhaga movement or Marjane Satrapi&rsquo;s background story behind the making of Persepolis or Chris Ware&rsquo;s documentation of the American Midwest are some of the well-articulated stories in the making of these works.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 3-5: Ideate, research, explore graphic storytelling ideas and create micro books, zines etc.</p>\n\n<p>This will be followed by 3 weeks to ideate, research, explore ideas of student&rsquo;s interest in their areas of discipline followed by field work, data collection and research on the ground. This will include visual data collection, interviews, recording, documentation and conceptualizing the idea based on the research.</p>\n\n<p>This will lead to create micro books, zines etc.</p>\n\n<p>Documentation of the research will be followed to process and distill the findings to create the core conceptual idea and be presented in the studio sessions for the benefit of collective brainstorming and discussions. These discussions with fellow classmates will led to an inter-disciplinary ideation and conceptualization, moving closer to shape and sharpen the core project ideas of the students. The students will also be expected to share the processing of their research findings along with their influences and inspirations.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 6-7: Exploring possibilities of form, conceptualization, layout, architecture etc. and presentation of a final project idea followed by discussion on similar ideas &amp; influences</p>\n\n<p>Moving on from research the course will discuss the working process of creating a visual narrative using multiple influences of form and genres. This will include detailed discussions on the various possibilities of the form i.e. different forms that can be explored -doodle narratives, popular comics, mobile based narratives, photo comics, design, layouts, page architecture, typography, sequential storytelling and the work process involved in each, enabling the students to make informed choices in sync with their ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Week 8: Presentation of a final project idea followed by discussion on similar ideas &amp; influences</p>\n\n<p>The following week the students will be expected to present their ideas and preliminary drafts as scribbles/ sketches with fellow batchmates, followed by open discussions, suggestions and ideation to evolve a clear understanding to flesh out the final narrative.</p>\n\n<p>Each student/ project will be further exposed to similar works through display and in-depth discussions on influences and ideas related to the project to lend a visual and storytelling perspective, enabling the practitioner to take one&rsquo;s work further.</p>\n\n<p>Besides creating multiple micro narratives through the semester, finally, the semester will move to its last weeks to create a bigger multi-page graphic narrative.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 9-14: Final completion with a mid-level presentation in week 11.</p>\n\n<p>A mid-level draft presentation will be shared in the studio to display the work in progress after 2 weeks then followed by the final 4 weeks or the end of the semester, ready for display, presentation and production. Studio presence in these weeks will be a must.</p>\n\n<p>Output Participation:</p>\n\n<p>Though the output will be individual, the process of production will be based on field research, short studio collaborations and conversations and work-in-progress presentations at regular intervals as discussed above.</p>\n\n<p>Course Deliverables: Every student will be expected to develop, produce multiple research-based short visual stories and graphic narratives/ comics.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Narrative based research, writing, basic drawing/ doodling, basic research photography, basic mobile photography.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reading List:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Understanding Comics / Scott Mcloud/ William Morrow Paperbacks; Reprint edition (27 April 1994)/ ISBN-10: &lrm;006097625X</p>\n\n<p>Graphic Novels: The definitive guide / Paul Gravett/ Harper Design: ISBN: &nbsp;0060824255</p>\n\n<p>Journalism / Joe Sacco/ Jonathan Cape (14 June 2018)/ ISBN-10: &lrm;178733130X</p>\n\n<p>Building Stories / Chris Ware/ / Jonathan Cape (4 October 2012)/ ISBN-10: &lrm;9780224078122</p>\n\n<p>Documenting Trauma in Comics / Dominic Davies/ Palgrave Macmillan; 1st ed. 2020 edition (21 May 2020)/ ISBN 3030379973</p>\n\n<p>Postcolonial Comics: Texts, Events, Identities/ Ed. by Binita Mehta, Pia Mukherji/</p>\n\n<p>Routledge; 1st edition (4 May 2015)/ ISBN-10: 041573813X</p>\n\n<p>The Indian Graphic Novel: Nation, history and critique/ Pramod K.

New Media Art that emerged in the wake of digital technology expanded the scope of artistic practice whilst being critical to the technologies it was mobilizing. Art in the time of the NFTs turned artworks into digital assets transacted predominantly through crypto and registered on a decentralized global network ledger called the blockchain. Mapping art&rsquo;s integral relationship with technology this course will unpack the diverse trajectories of video, new media, and digital art forms that disrupted the clean categories of traditional art history. Further, it will investigate the economic dimensions that accompany the proliferation of digital assets discussing whether the emergence of the NFTs as a registering standard positioned art as an alibi to normalize crypto as a global tender.</p>\n\n<p>The course begins by discussing the history of video art, from the early experiments of Nam June Paik to the immersive installations of Bill Viola, including seminal instances such as the Vision Exchange Workshop that led pioneering Indian artists Akbar Padamsee and Nalini Malani to explore the potentiality of video and animation. Drawing from the work of Ravi Sundaram, it will also discuss the proliferation of video and mobile phone technology across the Global South and how it transformed cultural production and consumption.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The course will also map the artistic responses to the internet &amp; digital surveillance technology through the practices of Antoni Muntadas, Jodi Brothers, Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, Trevor Paglen, CAMP (Mumbai), Hito Steyerl, Shilpa Gupta, Raqs Media Collective, and others. Further, it will introduce students to contemporary art practices driven by artificial intelligence including Refik Anadol, Entangled Others Studio, and Pindar Var Arman.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Followed by a detailed analysis of the seminal practices in the history of technology and art, the course also critically engages with the economic and ecological implications of NFTs on contemporary art.</p>\n\n<p>Course Modules: Each session of the course will include a theoretical component and a practical component, which will familiarize the students with the history of technology and art as well as, facilitate hands-on engagement with the digital artworks.</p>\n\n<p>Early Video History: A comprehensive history of video art from the 1960s-70s with reference to works of Nam June Paik, Valie Export, Vito Acconci, Joan Jonas, and Vision Exchange Workshop (1969 -72) led by Akbar Padamsee with Gieve Patel, Nalini Malani, Udayan Patel, Mani Kaul and Kumar Shahani.</p>\n\n<p>Informal Infrastructures: Mapping the late 1970s and 80s history of audio and video media circulation in the Global South through channels of informal networks of local television operators, video libraries, and theatres.</p>\n\n<p>Video and New Media Art India: Discusses the specific trajectories of video and new media art in India through the works of Baiju Parthan, Sonia Khurana, Nalini Malani, Ranbir Kaleka, Navjot Altaf, Shilpa Gupta, Raqs Media Collective, and BV Suresh.</p>\n\n<p>Novelty: By revisiting the seminal text The Language of New Media by Lev Manovich, this module introduces how the idea of newness and novelty shifted in the history of technology and art.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Democracy: Discusses how the idea of access to the arts changed from the Open Source conversations in the wake of the internet to the contemporary decentralized blockchain network.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Media Ecologies: &nbsp;Referring to the institutional histories of Khoj International Artists Association and Sarai Media Lab, New Delhi this module discusses how media technologies and artistic research reconfigured popular perceptions of urban neighborhoods in Delhi.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Collecting and archiving: Speaks about the multiple challenges in the history of collecting and archiving technology-based art due to their obsolescence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Aesthetics: Focuses on the diverse aesthetic trajectories of digital art history with a specific emphasis on immersion and interactivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Spectatorial Behaviors: With examples from global digital art institutions and exhibitions in the past few decades, this module maps the changes in the spectatorial behaviors of art led by technology.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Curating New Media Art: A module on the potentials and challenges of curating New Media art drawing from the longstanding research and work of Sarah Cook and Beryl Graham.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>NFTs and Contemporary Art: Discusses the economic and political reasons behind the massive proliferation of Non-fungible Tokens in contemporary art and the acknowledgment of non-human entity ERC-721 as the most powerful by the Art Review magazine in 2021.</p>\n\n<p>NFTs and Environment: This module discusses the comparatively less spoken environmental impact of minting NFTs. It also speaks about artists and technology activists embracing alternative forms of &lsquo;green NFTs&rsquo; that are ecologically sustainable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For the art or the money?: This module will discuss whether art registered as NFTs became an alibi through which crypto entered the mainstream in different parts of the world.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>By the end of this course, students:</p>\n\n<p>Will be well versed in the diverse histories of technology and art.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Will develop an understanding of art forms such as Video art, New Media art, AI art, and contemporary digital art in the NFT space. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Will develop a critical understanding of NFTs and their political and ecological impact.</p>\n\n<p>Will learn the process of ideating, planning, and executing an art exhibition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Christiane, Paul.
