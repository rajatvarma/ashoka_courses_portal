The topics covered will include physiological ecology, population ecology, species interactions, community ecology, succession and disturbance; ecosystem ecology, and biogeochemistry. Topics introduced in the lectures will be followed by in class-activities (and simulations) and discussions. For discussion sessions, I will suggest classic and recent research papers and students will lead discussions based on those. The course will allow reflecting on uncertainty and variation in natural processes from individual behavior to ecosystem services.

As a consequence, the molecular underpinnings of evolutionary processes remain at the periphery. In this advanced course, we aim to introduce students to the rich world of molecular evolution as well as the mechanisms thereof, starting with theory and ending with some techniques and real-world examples. The course is divided into two modules (M1: Laasya Samhita; M2: Sandeep Ameta).&nbsp; The first module will cover the molecular basis of variation, adaptation and selection. We will discuss how experimental evolution can be carried out in the laboratory, and how genetics, molecular biology and evolution blend in as we look at the evolution of genes and genomes. The second module will cover the principles of directed evolution and how it can be used to evolve/select functional biomolecules for various applications. We will discuss various techniques&nbsp;used for aptamers/ribozymes, proteins, therapeutic antibodies, enzymes, and metabolic pathway evolution. Additionally, some recent developments in implementing machine learning in guiding directed evolution experiments will also be discussed.</p>\n\n<p><u>Prerequisites</u>: This course requires a basic understanding of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Evolution which are covered in the following courses: Introduction to Genetics and Evolution, Understanding Structure and Function, and Chemical Basis of Life.

Since then, arguments about the distribution of resources and the proper remedy for inequality have been central to political and social movements, especially during the twentieth century. In this course we will examine the economic bases of income inequality in Chinese history, investigate strategies Chinese governments and individuals have used to mitigate rural and urban poverty, and come to appreciate how these economic realities affected people at all levels of Chinese society. Wealth and poverty were experienced differently according to factors including (but not limited to) gender, age, level of education, disability, sexuality, ethnicity, and location. We will read primary sources which illuminate a wide range of perspectives and consider, in conversation with the secondary literature, how to synthesise these materials. The written assessment for this class will be a writing portfolio including that will&nbsp;build towards developing expertise on a single Chinese region or locality.

Houses having windows coated with smart materials can keep the house cool during the hot summer days by preventing the heat penetration, and same time can generate electricity as well. Self-healing materials can repair small fractures caused by applied stress and thereby increase the lifetime. For example, if car gets scratches, it may heal itself. Smart biomaterials have recently evolved as a highly fascinating area to become an integral component in the modern-day improvement of human condition and quality of life. These are said to impact the modern medicines in various ways. Tissue engineering, drug delivery systems, medical devices are some of the areas where smart biomaterials have significant role to play.

Such compounds, called as stereoisomers, despite having exactly same elemental composition and formula may display huge differences in their properties, especially the way they interact with biological systems. A very basic example is found in the naturally occurring sugars which predominantly have D-chirality. We all know that the D-glucose is primary source of energy but L-glucose is totally different in that aspect. It is quite commonly observed fact that a particular enantiomer of the drug is biologically active while other remains silent. All this could be explained if their stereochemical aspects are considered. This course is designed to provide explanation about how certain subtle differences in spatial arrangements of atoms/groups in a compound can give rise to prominent effects. Stereochemistry is of particular importance in the field pharmaceuticals industry where it can provide great insights about designing new drugs.</p>\n\n<p>This course will also have some selected topics from heterocyclic chemistry. The contents within this part will provide a broad understanding of the major classes of heterocyclic compounds. &nbsp;Emphasis is given on the nomenclature, structure, properties, syntheses, and reactions of the simple 5 and 6-membered ring heterocycles, such as pyridines, pyrroles, furanes, thiophenes, indoles, quinoline and isoquinolines.</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>Course contents:</strong></u></p>\n\n<p><strong>Introduction &amp; Applictions:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Importance of stereochemistry in real life: some examples and a short history of stereochemistry, experiments &amp; methods</li>\n\t<li>The Significance of Chirality in Drug Design and Development</li>\n\t<li>Chemistry in 3D space, Chirality and its origin</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Nomenclature and Terminology:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Absolute (R/S and D,L) and relative configurations (Threo/erythro , syn/anti)</li>\n\t<li>Stereoisomers: Stereogenicity and topicity; Enantiomers, Diastereomers, Epimers, Anomers, Atropisomers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Conformatonal Analysis and It effect on recativities:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Conformations of acyclic systems and of cyclopentane and cyclohexane (mono and disubstituted)</li>\n\t<li>Stereoelectronic and steric principles in reactions: Substitution, elimination and addition; selectivity and specificity</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Chemistry of Heterocyclic compounds: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Introduction, Importance, Classification and nomenclature</li>\n\t<li>Structure, aromaticity in 5-numbered and 6-membered rings containing one heteroatom</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Synthesis &amp; Recations of some common Heterocylcic Compounds:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>General methods of synthesis for: Furan, Pyrrole (Paal-Knorr synthesis, Knorr pyrrole synthesis, Hantzsch synthesis), Thiophene, Pyridine (Hantzsch synthesis), Indole(Fischer indole synthesis and Madelung synthesis, reduction of o-nitrobenzaldehyde), Quinoline and isoquinoline, (Skraup synthesis, Friedlander&rsquo;s synthesis, Knorr quinoline synthesis</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n\n<p>-Stereochemistry by Eliel</p>\n\n<p>-Stereochemistry by Nasipuri</p>\n\n<p>-Introduction to the Chemistry of Heterocyclic compounds, John Welly&amp; Sons (1976) by R.M.

India&rsquo;s reading public, too, had to re-orient itself, seeking new associations with print that were driven by questions of usefulness, affordability and entertainment.

Cover the usual algorithmic paradigms and explore a toolkit of common algorithms.<br />\n2. Analyze the correctness and performance of these methods, and learn some principles of good design.<br />\n3. Explore different ways of thinking about and representing problems.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nDetailed coverage: Techniques for the design and analysis of efficient algorithms, emphasizing methods useful in practice. Topics include divide-and-conquer; dynamic programming; greedy algorithms; branch and bound; backtracking; amortized analysis; graph algorithms, especially flow. Advanced topics may include computational geometry, number theoretic algorithms, polynomial and matrix calculations, caching, and optionally, distributed and parallel computing.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This course will enable students to think algorithmically and&nbsp;apply imporant&nbsp;algorithms to advanced areas, including but not limited to Computer Science.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Pre-requisites: Data Structures, Probability and Statistics.&nbsp;We will not be using a textbook as such, but if you really want one, you can use the third edition of the textbook Introduction to Algorithms&nbsp;by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (MIT Press).

The privacy judgement of the Supreme Court of India read all such risks into the Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Indian constitution and broadly classified them as `privacy&#39;. However, the technical and operational standards for such privacy protection are not yet well developed. This has led to a constant tension between the state and the civil society and privacy activists resulting in several constitutional cases in the Supreme court and various High courts. The possibilities of inferential privacy and other human rights violations with modern machine learning -- whether deliberate or inadvertent -- &nbsp;or unfair and discriminatory processing of data, compound the problem.</p>\n\n<p>In this course we will unpack the privacy and other human rights requirements in such applications from both legal and technical points of view. We will investigate the possibilities of early alignment of the two and &nbsp;examine if it is possible to outline the necessary and sufficient conditions for privacy protection, as envisaged by the privacy judgement of the Supreme court of India. We will &nbsp;review the privacy enhancement techniques in computer science, ranging from encryption and applied cryptography, electronic voting, database and network security, trusted execution environments, blockchains, anonymization and other data minimisation techniques, and evaluate their suitability and efficacy for privacy protection. In the final part of the course we will investigate the architectural possibilities for privacy protection - from both &nbsp;legal and technical perspectives - that may help not only in design but also in assessing vulnerabilities and omissions.</p>\n\n<p>The evaluations in this course will be based on scribing, reading and presentations, small implementations and a project cum term paper.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>In this course we will unpack the privacy and other human rights requirements in such applications from both legal and technical points of view.

It considers these vital acts &ndash; of reading a text closely, of making connections between different subjects, of participating in an ongoing conversation, of being discerning about source material &ndash; as essential habits that can be strengthened through repetition. The course provides space in which you can engage with a variety of source materials and understand how to ask questions that extend and enrich your understanding -- of situations, texts, institutions and people. It is also intended to be an induction into the distinct practices of academic research and writing within a university. By the close of the course, you will have a keener sense of your own processes of learning, thinking and writing, and a more robust sense of what it means to be &lsquo;scholar&rsquo; in an active knowledge community constituted by your peers.</p>\n\n<p>This is an unthemed ICT, which means that we will cycle through different topics rather than focus on one principle subject.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Reading</strong></p>\n\n<p>1. Breaking down texts into identifiable parts.</p>\n\n<p>2. Making patterns and connections across texts</p>\n\n<p>3. Building reading stamina and the ability to select texts</p>\n\n<p>4. Understanding textual context, genre and source material</p>\n\n<p><strong>Writing&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>1. Developing the craft of outlining, revising, editing</p>\n\n<p>2. Applying form, voice, style, tone to affect writing</p>\n\n<p>3. Developing logical, coherent, structured writing</p>\n\n<p>4. Using explanatory, narrative and justificatory writing</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thinking</strong></p>\n\n<p>1. Practising converting thoughts into words</p>\n\n<p>2. Narrowing down a curiosity or thought into a question</p>\n\n<p>3. Constructing and developing a reasoned argument</p>\n\n<p>4. Engaging meaningfully with multiple perspectives</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speaking and Listening</strong></p>\n\n<p>1. Aiming for confidence, clarity, coherence&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>2.

Engaging meaningfully with ongoing discussions</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>You do not need to have any specific kind of training in order to do an ICT course. Nor is any ICT course geared towards preparing you specifically for a career in a particular subject or field. Rather, you can expect it to guide you in transition out of how you approached academic work in school to how you might approach it in a university setting, and to sharpen your understanding of what it means to be critical, questioning and deliberate in your approach to the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>ICT is writing-intensive. You can expect to work on longer assignments (the Mid-Term and the End-Term essays) over multiple rounds of feedback, as well as shorter assignments through the semester. You will also need to rehearse regular habits of reading (of academic texts and wider materials) and responding (to prompts, or given materials).Finally, as the ICT is a small cohort-oriented course, you can expect it to have a strong participation and interaction component, and can expect to work on projects both individually and in collaboration with your coursemates.&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The ICT will be graded on a number of elements. Your final assessment will account for your participation and performance in writing and non-writing components, and in formative work (building towards a bigger piece, or continuing a specific &lsquo;habit&rsquo;) and summative work (producing a final output).&nbsp;The components are below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>1. Participation (in classes, meetings and peer work)</p>\n\n<p>2. Regular Assignments&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>3. Presentation&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>4. A mid-term assignment of 800-1500 words involving the synthesis of multiple sources</p>\n\n<p>5. An end-term Academic essay of 1500 - 2500 words</p>\n\n<p>6. Improvement over the course</p>\n\n<p>A standard Ashoka rubric will be used in your eventual ICT grade, wherein the highest possible grade is &lsquo;A&rsquo; and the lowest possible grade is &lsquo;F&rsquo;.In general, grades in the &lsquo;A&rsquo; range demonstrate that you have consistently exceeded the expectations of the course; grades in the &lsquo;B&rsquo; range indicate that you have met the expectations for the course; grades in the &lsquo;C&rsquo; range and below, demonstrate that you have fallen short of the expectations for this course.&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>For this course, you are allowed three unexcused absences (for which you do not need permission from the instructor) and two excused absences (for which you do need permission from the instructor). The penalty for any absence beyond these five will be decided by the ICT instructor on a case-by-case basis. Please note that a consistent pattern of non-attendance may include discretionary penalties such as grade cuts.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If you are absent, the responsibility for making up for what has been missed -- by looking at class notes and/or speaking to classmates -- is yours.

In effect, you will learn to ask the &lsquo;why&rsquo; and &lsquo;how&rsquo; questions alongside the &lsquo;who&rsquo; and &lsquo;what&rsquo; queries you have been posing through your school education. You will engage with a variety of source materials and understand how to ask questions that extend and enrich your understanding&mdash;of situations, texts, institutions and people. You will explore the distinctness of academic research and writing, and participate in an active knowledge community constituted by your peers. By the close of the course, you will have a clearer understanding of what it means to be a scholar in an academic setting, and a keener sense of your own processes of learning, thinking and writing.</p>\n\n<p>The theme of this course this Monsoon Semester will be Reading the Other, where we will be reading narrative non-fiction works by David Baldwin, Meena Kandasamy, Nanjala Nyabola, Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar, Gopal Guru, Sharmila Rege and others to enable you to acquire the skills described above with an added understanding of what it means to read works by or about individuals or communities who are outside your own comfort zone.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Learning Outcomes</p>\n\n<p>Reading:</p>\n\n<p>1.

Why do people write in prisons? Why do people write about prisons? Why should we read these narratives? These writings have often been valued as counter histories or for the political significance they hold. But what happens when we read these narratives as literature? What does a literary framework do that other disciplines of engagement cannot? How does a literary framework enhance the socio-political importance of these writings but also what are some of the ethical constraints that come with its association with the literary and how does it challenge the limitations of literature itself ?&nbsp;Though the relationship between writing and imprisonment is as old as the institution of confinement, we will focus on how prison literature in postcolonial and post emancipation era offers a distinct critique of imprisonment that has gained its legitimacy in the rhetoric of modernity, in its claims of upholding humane, democratic values and its promises of being reformative in nature.&nbsp;We will explore how the narrative power of these writings&nbsp;investigates the construction of categories like &lsquo;the human&rsquo; and &lsquo;the criminal&rsquo;, thereby revealing how carceral structures participate in the formation of racial and colonial subjectivities as outside of the domain of the human, that constantly need to be disciplined into being one but can never be.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the prison narratives we will look at are Behrouz Boochani&rsquo;s&nbsp;No Friend but the Mountains, Sinan Antoon&rsquo;s&nbsp;Ijaam, Naguib Mahfouz&rsquo;s&nbsp;Karnak Cafe, Mohamedou Ould Slahi&rsquo;s&nbsp;Guantanamo Diary, Elias Khourey&rsquo;s&nbsp;Yalo, Chester Himes&rsquo;s&nbsp;Cast the First Stone&nbsp;and Varavara Rao&rsquo;s&nbsp;Captive Imagination.</p>\n</div></div>",

In this course, we will be endeavoring to work with such a framing in understanding the fundamentals of a field of inquiry often referred to as Critical Race Theory. While this course will focus largely on critically examining race, race consciousness and racism in literary and cultural texts across Europe and the United States, it will also look at race at the intersections of and in counterpoints with other marginalities such as gender and gender identity, class, caste, sexuality, and nationality. We will be attempting to map the contours of a wider landscape of bigotry, and in doing so reflect upon the insights that such a cartography can offer regarding the &ldquo;systemic&rdquo; forces that shape our own experiential locus and locations.</p>\n</div></div>",

We will be re-questioning the idea of &lsquo;what is a&nbsp;drawing&rsquo; and what role it plays in critiquing contemporary socio-political systems. Students may work with cut-outs, stencils, printmaking, and collages as means of experimenting with new ways of seeing, experiencing, and visualizing, leading towards a collective on-site work as part of the end-semester presentations.</p>\n</div></div>",

We start with preliminary topics like logic and reasoning. First few topics include set theory, linear equations and their solutions.

There are 26 scheduled lectures, of which 2 will be reserved for the two midterms. The class will effectively meet 24 times during the semester. If a student&rsquo;s lecture attendance falls below 17 lectures (~ 71% of 24), then the student will earn nothing&nbsp;on the Participation Grade (0 on 10% of the total course score). This almost certainly amounts to the difference between two consecutive letter grades, and in some cases between three consecutive letter grades.<br />\n<br />\nI will be taking a roll call at the beginning of every class.

This is what I mean by timely attendance.<br />\n<br />\nDue to seminars, conferences, or other such scholarly&nbsp;engagements, I might be traveling for some days of the semester. If I am out of the station on a lecture day and unable to teach in person, I will make up for it either through an in-person lecture&nbsp;or an online lecture on a pre-agreed date or time. If I teach an online lecture, I will take note of the Zoom attendance log to determine your participation points.<br />\n<br />\nFinally, it is called Participation Grade so a student must not engage in anything that qualifies as non-participatory or disruptive behavior including (but not limited to) using laptops/ tablets/ cellphones for purposes not related to the course, sleeping in class, studying for another course in class, chit-chatting, leaving the lecture early without permission, etc. Non-participatory or disruptive behavior will lead to the cancellation of attendance points for that particular lecture.<br />\n<br />\n<u>During the first couple of weeks (shopping weeks)</u></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>If you are attending my lectures without being enrolled in the course, make your presence known so that I can mark you as attended (even when your name isn&#39;t on the roster)</li>\n\t<li>If you miss the first couple of lectures and enroll in the course late, how will I calculate your attendance points? Ans: Just like anybody else&#39;s. The total&nbsp;number of lectures attended out of 24. If less than 17, zero on participation.</li>\n\t<li>During the shopping weeks, if&nbsp;you are contemplating whether or not to enroll in my course, given point 2 it would be best (for your sake) to attend the lectures and do as instructed in point 1.</li>\n</ol>\n</div></div>",

ECO-2202-5 is designed to initiate your journey to develop, formalize and defend this mindset. I will use the basics of modern growth theory to teach the way of addressing macroeconomic problems. It starts by studying one of the most widely asked questions in macroeconomics - how countries grow around the world. We will analyze various sources of growth through theoretical models and explore ways to empirically support the theoretical findings.

In addition, we will consider the nature of social exclusion in India, with a special focus on caste.</p>\n\n<p>Through its interactive discussion-based format as well as by giving you the opportunity of engaging in a substantive empirical research project, this course hopes to give you a deep dive into understanding how economic principles interplay with social forces to shape the Indian development experience.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><ul>\n\t<li>Reading summary: 3%</li>\n\t<li>Class participation: 20%</li>\n\t<li>Pop quizzes: 15%</li>\n\t<li>Class exercises and assignments: 25%</li>\n\t<li>Group project: 37%</li>\n</ul>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Class discussions are central to the way we will all learn in this course. These discussions will occur in two ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>after the summary of a reading is posted on Moodle, students may post responses, or additional questions and/or discussion points on that reading. Only comments posted until 11:55pm on the night prior to the class will count towards the participation grade.</li>\n\t<li>during class meetings, we will have discussions on the readings, based on the summary, discussion points etc posted on Moodle. Students should expect to be cold-called by the instructor during class.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Class participation will be graded on a simple scale: 0 if you are absent, 1 if you are present, and 2 if you are present and actively participating. For the purposes of receiving a score of 2, active participation in the online discussion and active participation in the discussion in class will be treated as substitutes. However, absence from class will result in a score of 0 irrespective of your participation online.</p>\n\n<p>Grading is the sole prerogative of the Teaching Assistants and the instructor.</p>\n\n<p>Attendance will be taken in the first 5 minutes of a class meeting. If you are not present during that time, you will be marked absent for the day. Please make it a point to be punctual. The instructor reserves the right to mark you absent if you leave for a substantial part of the class after attendance is taken.</p>\n\n<p>The number of assessment points for class participation are not pre-determined. The lowest 15% of such assessments (including absences) will be dropped in the computation of your final class participation grade.</p>\n\n<p>There is no concept of &lsquo;excused absences&rsquo; in this course, other than in exceptional cases of protracted illness, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Absence from more than eight class meetings at which class participation is assessed, will result in automatic failure in the course.</p>\n</div></div>",

The course will focus on evidence related to caste and sex in India.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The first part of the course will take students through theories of discrimination such as statistical discrimination and taste for discrimination, based on the work of Kenneth Arrow, Gary Becker and George Akerlof.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will lead to a discussion of the overlap between economics of discrimination and related sub-disciplines that are relatively new but are rapidly expanding, viz., &ldquo;Identity Economics&rdquo;, pioneered by George Akerlof and Rachel Kranton, &ldquo;Feminist Economics&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Stratification Economics&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The second section will introduce students to concepts in social psychology such as stereotype threat and implicit bias that produce discriminatory outcomes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The third part of the course introduces students to some of the key methods of empirically gauging discrimination in market settings. This section would familiarize students with decomposition analyses applied to the labour market (what part of the wage gap between two groups is due to differences in abilities, and what part is due to discrimination), using standard techniques from Labour Economics. We would also discuss experimental methods &ndash; both field-based as well as lab-based experiments to gauge discrimination outside the labour market (e.g. housing market), or in the field of charitable giving, or even in labour markets but during the job search process (before applicants find jobs).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Students will be familiarized with literature that applies these methods in the Indian context, particularly to the study of caste and gender discrimination.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The final part of the course will deal with policy options to deal with group-based disparities and discrimination, with a focus on affirmative action policies. This section will outline the various types of affirmative action, including quotas or reservation, and discuss debates around affirmative action, focusing on evidence-based research gauging its impact.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Course Outline and Reading List&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Note: This reading list could see minor changes during the semester which will be announced well ahead of time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Overall reference:&nbsp;A.

The course will be broadly divided into two parts. In the first part, we will cover the fundamentals of evolutionary game theory. This part will introduce students to large population games and different evolutionary dynamics used in this field of game theory.

While establishing solid foundations in computer programming &amp; data science, the course will inspire &amp; enable students to leverage state of the art computational techniques to areas of their choice. The intended audience for this course is First Year MA economics students. This course is structured into 2 phases:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 1:</strong> <em><strong>Lay the foundation </strong>--&gt; </em>Foundations of Computer Science &amp; Data Science, learning Python along the way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 2: </strong><em><strong>Build your skyscraper</strong> --&gt;</em> Students solve a problem of practical importance using the foundation of Phase 1. There is no upper bar in this phase. Often, students set ambitious goals and end-up going well beyond phase 1 in order to accomplishing them.

Is there a unified body of works that qualifies to be called &ldquo;Indian&rdquo;? Or is Indianness an aggregation of multiple conceptions of what is &ldquo;India&rdquo;? From the period of the early nationalist writings of Rabindranath Tagore and Premchand at the beginning of the twentieth century to present day, this course attempts to deal with works in the plethora of Indian languages such as, but not limited to, Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi, Urdu, Gujarati, English, Bengali, and others. It endeavours to engage with themes and ideas such as questions of nation and nationalism, the self in relation to society, and caste and discrimination. It will study pivotal moments of nation-making, such as Partition, and focus on experimentation in writing that takes place under the rubric of movements such as modernism, in the form of poems, novels, short stories, and plays. The course aims to introduce students to a multiplicity of voices that constitute the term &ldquo;Indian Literature&rdquo; in an effort to draw attention to the study of&nbsp;literatures of the languages that call India their home.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

We will be discussing the works of Rabindranath Tagore, Premchand, Intizar Hussain, Ambai, Kiran Nagarkar, U R Ananthamurthy, Vaikom Muhammad Bashir and Indira Goswami among others. We will also be screening film adaptations of the key works of some of these authors. The course will pay special attention to such movements in Indian literature as the Progressive Writers movement and regional modernisms. We shall be exploring the questions of caste, class, gender and nation in Indian literatures and study different genres such as the novel, short story and poetry. The theorists and critics we will read, in order to situate our discussion of Indian literature in a wider historical, political and theoretical context, include Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Walter Benjamin, Gilles Deleuze, Shamsur Rahman Faruqi and G.N.Devy. Is there an &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; literature? What is the relation between modern literatures in Indian languages and the forms of the nation? What are the theoretical and political stakes in the debate(s) on realism and modernism in Indian literatures? How do we think the idea of a &lsquo;comparative literature&rsquo; in relation to Indian literatures? How do we approach the politics and ethics of translation in the situation opened up by translations from and between Indian languages?

Each age and culture makes its own Alexander. Depicted as prophet and proto-Jesus or demi-God and demon, each Alexander mirrors the spirit and desires of the host culture. Following in the footsteps of Alexander we will travel through time and space, traversing the width of Eurasia and two millennia in tales. Together with Alexander we will encounter topless Amazons and nudist Brahmins, venture into the Land of Darkness and search for the Source of Life. Our class will be an excursion of intrepid explorers who venture into unknown (literary) territories. In the course of this journey we will read excerpts from the Bible, Plutarch, Josephus, the Babylonian Talmud, the Quran and the adaptations of the Greek Alexander Romance in Syriac, Ge&rsquo;ez, Persian and the languages of mediaeval Europe. We will analyse the transformation of Alexander&rsquo;s legends in visual culture from manuscript illuminations to their depictions on the screen. We will read texts in fine-grained detail and also learn to zoom out for an overview of the developments of narratives and motifs. Though we will study literature on Alexander in translation, we will supplement our reading with references to the source languages and their literary contexts. In the course of the seminar you will be exposed to topics in historical criticism and narratological studies &mdash; What is a stemma? What is an Urtext? How and why do motifs transform.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

How, in short, might we become better readers of Shakespeare by becoming better readers of masala Indian film, better readers of masala Indian film by becoming better readers of Shakespeare, and better students of Indian culture, history and politics by becoming better readers of both Shakespeare and Bollywood?</p>\n</div></div>",

From popular television shows to fantasy novels to divisive political rhetoric, the medieval pops up where we least expect it, shaping our views of the present as well as of the past. In this class, we will examine the phenomenon called &ldquo;medievalism,&rdquo; which refers to reimaginations, and reenactments of medieval culture in post-medieval times. Reading medieval literary works alongside literature and films that these works inspired, we will investigate the sources and creative outputs of the continued fascination with medieval culture in Europe and Japan as well as in regions that may never have had a &lsquo;middle age&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>We will begin with medievalist rhetoric in the contemporary political arena&mdash;from the display of medieval shields in the &ldquo;Unite the Right&rdquo; rally in the United States to celebrations and rejections of the &lsquo;medieval&rsquo; in Putin&rsquo;s Russia and Modi&rsquo;s India. We will then turn to different themes within literary and cinematic medievalism, starting with some of the texts that inspired J.R.R. Tolkien&rsquo;s fantasy world. We will go on to examine fictions about and inspired by medieval accounts of knights, samurai, and women saints and warriors. We will conclude with the film Mughal-e-Azam, considering how the use of a past that may or may not be called medieval has been deployed in service of an image of national unity. In these examinations, we will interrogate the category of the medieval itself by focusing on regions beyond those that &#39;medievalism&#39; traditionally includes, and we consider how different uses of the past continue to shape our present and future.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

This course provides an opportunity to critically assess the stories that shaped our understanding of morals, culture, and values, as well as those we will impart to future generations. In this discussion-oriented interactive course, we will read and review children&rsquo;s books, examine the purposes of visual literacy, and write reviews on specific authors and illustrators. We will write our own children&rsquo;s book to gauge all that we have learnt.</p>\n\n<p>This course aims to examine how the books children read shape their outlook and emotional development. We will study the historical, creative, nurturing, emotional, and educational aspects of these forms of literature and their impact on us later in life. We will also consider why a study of children&rsquo;s literature is important, and how it impacts pedagogies for children across borders.</p>\n\n<p>We will examine the views of multiple theoretical thinkers and texts in conjunction with actual children&#39;s literature. We will ask the important but often overlooked questions about this particular genre, mainly focusing on Indian and Western children&rsquo;s literature. The purpose is not so much to compare these two cultural offerings, but to give us a taste of both.</p>\n\n<p>We shall consider popular stories for children up to 12 years old, including Harry Potter &amp; The Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone, Amar Chitra Katha, Matilda, The Little Prince, Feluda and Mulan. At the same time, we will also study theoretical thinkers such as Jack Zipes, Seth Lerer, Paulo Freire, and Bruno Bettelheim to help us navigate the complex field of children&rsquo;s literature in relation to issues of culture, religion, difference, gender, and sexuality.</p>\n\n<p>We will unpack the didactic intent as well as the pleasure principle that might have prompted the writers. Authorial intent is, however, only one part of our study; the other part is to see how children and parents receive these stories. Children&rsquo;s literature creates moral as well as national frameworks that help acculturate young people.

The course aims first to study the background of the modernist movement, for example, through the works of Freud and Walter Benjamin, and then engage with the works of writers across genres (with a special focus on poetry) such as, but not limited to, Charles Baudelaire, Arthur Rimbaud, T.S. Eliot, W.B. Yeats, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Samuel Beckett, Franz Kafka, and others. It tries to explore how these writers dealt with questions of the fragmentation of identity, the struggles of human existence, and the shift away from the realist trends of nineteenth-century literature to a psychological exploration of the human mind.</p>\n</div></div>",

However it is important to remember that the Qurʾan, while being the foundational scripture of one of the world&rsquo;s largest religions, is also an important historic and literary document from Arabia of this time. In this course, we will explore the emergence of the Qurʾan (from Arabic qurʾān, &lsquo;reading&rsquo; or &lsquo;recitation&rsquo;) and read it as a religious, historic and literary document -firmly situated within the cultural and historical milieux of Late Antiquity (ca. 3rd - 8th century CE). This course will introduce you to two exegetical worlds, the historical-critical study of the Qurʾan and Islamic exegesis (tafsīr). Notwithstanding their different approaches, premises and biases, they both share a fundamental commitment to close and patient reading, and an enduring fascination with the text of the Qurʾan. The initial segment of the course will focus on tracing the Qurʾan&#39;s origins within its historical context. We will delve into the intertextuality of Qurʾanic narratives and their Jewish and Christian counterparts. In the second part of the course we will read together excerpts from the 18th chapter of the Qurʾan, called Sūrat al-Kahf, accompanied by the seminal commentary known as the Tafsīr al-Jalālayn (15 th century CE). Sūrat al-Kahf is a particularly fitting since it offers a unique window into the rich literary worlds of Late Antiquity. Within its verses, a diverse collage of characters, motifs, and narratives unfolds, ranging from enigmatic sleeping youths and the prophet Moses to Alexander&rsquo;s Doppelg&auml;nger Dhū l-Qarnayn.</p>\n</div></div>",

These texts will take us through different types of friendship, from the homosocial bonds that undergird early modern English lyric poetry to spiritual friendships in Bhakti poetry to women&rsquo;s friendships in Victorian England to the trope of the gay best friend in contemporary film and finally to the blurry line between friend and enemy in the contemporary novel.</p>\n</div></div>",

Routine Eurocentric readings of Shakespeare assume that Christianity is the only religious influence on Shakespeare&rsquo;s work. And that Europe derived its poetic traditions autochthonously. But both these assumptions point to a paucity of the imagination rather than being an actual statement of fact. A play like Romeo and Juliet, for instance, owes a lot to Persian tales like Laila-Majnun and Shirin-Farhad. And a play like Richard II shares an investment in the poetic exploration of desire with the entire corpus of Sufi poetry. In the belief that it is time to present these Persianate links as avenues for exploration, this class will foreground the theoretical question of queer desire. The aesthetics of power, the impossibility of fulfilled desire, an enchantment with rhetorical dexterity, a depth of tumultuous affect, are some of the ideas with which we will engage in our twin exploration of Sufi and Shakespearean poetry and desire.</p>\n</div></div>",

Examining patterns of reading and literary education in different parts of the historical British Empire, it will consider unifying patterns of such education in the colonies along with their postcolonial legacies: structures of universities, curricula, and an often-overlapping body of English texts. It will also examine how this pushed a body of imaginative readers to read against the variously limiting and exclusionary structures of colonial and postcolonial education, creating figures of disruptive autodidactism. Our focus will be on South Africa, West Indies, and India, and we&rsquo;ll read texts by Es&rsquo;kia Mphahlele, Njabulo Ndebele, Sindiwe Magona, C.L.R. James, V.S.

While the emergence of sprawling industrial cities in the nineteenth century can be said to have produced new kinds of experience that in turn condition some of the aesthetic innovations of the historic avant garde, cities are not islands within some sort of unremarkable &quot;provincial&quot; terra nullius. Indeed, to equate the &quot;urban&quot; with the &quot;modern&quot; is itself a kind of provincialism, one that fetishizes the former based on the concentration of capital and political power that one finds in large cities. In point of fact, even the most seemingly rustic landscapes often bear the marks of their integration into global relations of production, while the growth of massive conurbations like the one in which this class will be conducted, India&#39;s National Capital Region, give lie to reified conceptions of city and country. Even so, one need not look far in contemporary politics, culture, or even literary theory and criticism to find this obviously false dichotomy at work. As a means of critiquing the ideological divide between city and country, we will read fictional texts from a variety of traditions that deal with that very problem by authors such as Thomas Hardy, Ishimure Michiko, Arun Kolatkar, and W.G.

The aim is to free pedagogy, reading, and creative-critical interaction with both Indian and European texts from the interpretative parameters of &nbsp;&#39;Western modernity&#39;, while also rejecting categories like &#39;non-Western modernity&#39; that serve a merely corrective purpose. Instead, I wish to enquire afresh into the journey of literary and artistic modernity, using writing from India as my starting-point. I also plan to bring in some material from outside India &ndash; the stories of Junichiro Tanizaki, for instance.&nbsp; The question in the course title is one I asked myself as I began putting together the anthology I mention above in the late 1990s. How was one to conceive of a tradition called &#39;Indian literature&#39;? Was it the total of the various literatures of India? Or was there another way of exploring this category? It was a time when the Indian novel in English and the idea of &#39;postcolonial literature&#39; had begun to dominate. How did the modernist and avant garde trajectories of literatures in the Indian languages fit into these relatively recent categorisations? One of my own reasons for rethinking and enlarging the frame had to do with my affinities with modernism as a reader and writer, affinities that seemed out of place post-Midnight&#39;s Children, but not so out of place within the experimental histories of&nbsp;modern Indian literatures themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The use of the word &#39;modern&#39; was, and is, deliberate, to point to developments that the term &#39;postcolonial&#39; doesn&#39;t address. The texts we&#39;ll read here would follow, without too much narrow systematising, &lsquo;Indian literature&rsquo; and the way its emergence from the late nineteenth century in various languages embodied the trajectory of modernity, modernism, the avant garde, and formal preoccupations in India. The course means to question the largely theme-driven, Anglophone parameters of the &lsquo;postcolonial&rsquo; that have been with us for some decades now.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As in 2023, this will be a hybrid course, co-hosted by The Oxford Research Centre of the Humanities.

Amongst others, we will read: Sigmund Freud, D.W. Winnicott, Masud Khan, Osaumu Kitayama, Melanie Klein, Otto Rank and Octave Mannoni. As we read, we will discuss how and to what extent the concepts we read about translate from the language of psychoanalysis into the language of literary English, and from the clinic into other human experiences.</p>\n</div></div>",

Some even go as far as calling it akin to childbirth, but I will spare you the gendered imagery. Yet, I will say it is indeed intimate, private, personal and momentous. At the same time, graduate students often feel that writing within an academic institution does not bear much relevance to their lives outside of academia. To dispel such myths and make more happy ones for ourselves, in this course we will ask; How should we begin to think about writing? How is it possible to learn to write? Is writing purely a technical craft? What is criticism and how do we write critically about literature?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;While we discuss and dissent on the answers to these questions, we will also learn about all the delicate ways in which a hypothesis can be formulated, how to fashionably synthesize materials from written sources, organize ideas in almost perfect forms and develop marvelously captivating arguments.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

The world of medicine is undergoing changes with A.I. being used to identify cancerous cells.

This has been equally matched by shifting young adult preferences, especially from socially conscious and economically secure backgrounds, who are looking for opportunities to enhance their social contribution through their professional lives. The opportunities to affect social change have therefore grown exponentially &ndash; in the form of public sector fellowships, lateral entries into government, social sector/not for profit roles, research and think-tanks, entrepreneurship and start-ups, as well areas like social sector consulting and impact investing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>However, even as the inputs (people as well as money) increase manifold into this space, the improvement in outcomes is much slower. </strong>The quality of public-sector school education remains poor and successive NAS/ASER reports do not indicate a secular upward trend; even over decades. Public health systems still provide for only 30% of India&rsquo;s population with 70% people paying out of pocket for healthcare needs. Metrics like IMR/MMR/immunization rates or stunting are barely moving. Despite increasing subsidies and numerous programs, agriculture that engages 45% of India&rsquo;s workforce, it is not remunerative and holds limited attraction for youth as a talent pool. The average monthly income per agricultural household is just ₹10,218 with just 4-5% annual growth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where does this dichotomy of increased inputs and yet stagnant outcomes come from?</strong> Why do entrepreneurial innovations typically not scale and lead to transformative outcomes? What structural factors lie at the heart of it? How can those who are looking to enter this space understand and begin to tackle this dichotomy from day 1? We hope that this course will help you answer some of these essential questions and better prepare you for a professional career that interacts with this space in any shape or form.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/fc7c9a80-2e68-4eb3-94b0-457b38a533ef.pdf' download='Deconstructing Social Sector Systems.pdf'>Deconstructing Social Sector Systems.pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

Or maybe you do. Who knows, and who cares, because either way, a general understanding of key legal concepts &ndash; and the ability to think like a lawyer &ndash; will add invaluably to your arsenal as you step out into the real world. This knowledge and skillset will make you a distinctly sharper leader in the business world, because legal issues routinely &ndash; and increasingly &ndash; strike at the heart of business risks and opportunities, and are integral to overall corporate strategy. And so not just lawyers but a wide range of business executives (including C-suite executives) and their advisors routinely work on legal issues alongside lawyers. Legal roles are increasingly business roles, and vice versa. Therefore, the knowledge and skills this course provides will make you a sharper entrepreneur, or a sharper business executive, or a sharper consultant to businesses across sectors. But that&rsquo;s not all. The benefits extend to countless roles even beyond the business world: you&rsquo;ll be a sharper problem-solver regardless of field. To this end, the course will explore key concepts across several fundamental areas of law including contracts, torts, constitutional, criminal, administrative, competition, and procedural &ndash; each of which is applicable across a wide range of professional fields. The course will explore these concepts in two jurisdictions: India and the U.S. The course will also introduce students to thinking (and related) skills fundamental to not just the legal profession but also to the many professional roles (discussed above) that require frequent engagement with the law or with lawyers. These skills include: contract construction and interpretation; analyzing and applying a case; textual interpretation more broadly; analytical writing; persuasive writing; persuasive verbal argument; and highly analytical thinking with unrelenting precision, agility, and creativity.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/0bfc963d-3e52-4598-9efd-e85ca7f75c7f.pdf' download='ENT-2039 Law and Lawyerly Thinking_ An Introduction for Entrepreneurs and Beyond.pdf'>ENT-2039 Law and Lawyerly Thinking_ An Introduction for Entrepreneurs and Beyond.pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

An example of this is algorithmic trading where an algorithm uses trading data to determine when you should buy or sell a stock in the market. It becomes more interesting when the income tax department assess a lot of data about individual taxpayers and determines that some of the citizens are not paying enough in taxes. The third example is based on the idea of who should be given a credit card. Most people who have high savings qualify for a credit card but what about those people who have low to medium savings. What about students at Ashoka? Many of these decisions in finance, such as selling a stock, obtaining a credit card, and identifying defaulters, are based on technology, mathematical algorithms, and knowledge of finance. A person who masters these 3 fields can work for large companies, set-up their own start-up, trade in the markets, pursue a career in research, become a financial consultant and pursue many more opportunities than what is mentioned here. The course starts with a brief understanding of markets and data that we can obtain for these markets. Then we look at how to use this data to decide if we should buy or sell a stock or bond. After having evaluated it heuristically we try to explore algorithms that can fit the behaviour of the data and perhaps indicate the buy and sell decision. Similarly, we apply this broad principle of identifying the data, examining it and then determining which model should be fitted to different problems in finance including predicting stock price, detecting fraud, providing credit, pricing options, sizing of companies based on financial attributes. Companies worldwide are looking for talented people who can understand different parts of finance and apply the right tools and techniques to analyze the products, customers and services. Our goal is to provide students an opportunity to learn these skills and see challenging careers in finance globally. It is oriented towards undergraduates who may not necessarily have coding skills. The audience is expected to have the willingness to learn and explore. The focus will be to help students create a portfolio of projects where they can demonstrate the application of data analytics</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/b68e0ace-c439-4860-9a45-a859accd8432.pdf' download='Financial Analytics and Artificial Intelligance - Tushar Jaruhar (3).pdf'>Financial Analytics and Artificial Intelligance - Tushar Jaruhar (3).pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

This is the question that drives policies and practices to envision a low-carbon future. How can we craft a just and inclusive low-carbon world? What are the opportunities that are offered by moving towards a low-carbon world, what are the challenges that need to be addressed, and what new challenges does it pose? This course is inspired by these questions. The course explores how the idea of low carbon is being discussed and implemented in various facets of life and diverse socio-cultural and economic contexts.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The course is divided into different modules, and it begins with a brief discussion of the underlying debates around the idea of low-carbon society at local and global levels. The modules focus on the low-carbon solutions being offered in different areas such as energy, transportation, ecology, infrastructure, lifestyle, urbanisation, and industries. Each of these modules will discuss the underlying problems that led to the present debate on low-carbon interventions specific to the focus area of the module, how different low-carbon solutions are envisioned, and the opportunities and challenges in different contexts. Case studies from different regional contexts will be explored in the course.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Students are encouraged to bring in examples from their experiences and day-to-day life. The classes will include lectures, documentary/video presentations, and a field visit. Additional background material will be provided during the lectures to supplement the readings.

Global and local level changes in the environment affect people&rsquo;s livelihoods in different ways. On the other hand, changing livelihoods due to changing policy and socio-economic scenarios also drive environmental changes. This course aims to explore this multi-dimensional and complex relationship between different environments and livelihoods with a focus on the Global South.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How do environmental changes drive livelihood changes? How does it affect the livelihood diversity of different communities, including indigenous groups? What are the implications of these livelihood changes to socio-environmental and cultural sustainability? In what ways do the communities build resilience and adapt to these situations? How do livelihood changes affect the environment? What are the social, economic and policy factors that contribute to these livelihood changes? How do civil society organisations and policy-level actions try to overcome these challenges? These are some of the questions explored through this course. The specific areas the course focuses on include climate change, environmental degradation, natural events, changes in land and aquatic ecosystems, biodiversity loss, and water shortages.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Students are encouraged to bring in examples from their experiences or knowledge. The classes will include lectures, documentary/video presentations, and a field visit. Additional background material will be provided during the lectures to supplement the readings.

In this course, we will explore the state of community ecology today, which appears less as a set of clear-cut facts and more as a continuation of a series of (often heated) debates spanning more than a century regarding the very nature of plant and animal communities. We will then expand our scope and examine interactions between biological communities and their physical environments, which comes under the purview of ecosystem ecology. This course is structured as deep dives into select topics in community and ecosystem ecology, designed to equip students with a holistic understanding of the complexity and interconnectedness of life on earth, and the ability critically analyze research in these disciplines. Topics covered in the course have relevance to diverse applications such as ecosystem management, conservation, climate change mitigation, etc. Initial lectures will recap basic ecological concepts. Some of the topics covered thereafter include: (a) major debates regarding the nature of biological communities: the holism-individualism debate, the density-dependence debate, the ecological assembly-rules debate, and the niche-neutral debate, (b) species coexistence theories, (c) facilitation, a neglected aspect of community interactions, (d) the phylogenetic structure of communities, (e) functional trait ecology, (f) the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (productivity, complementarity, selection effects, functional redundancy, etc.), (g) ecosystem resilience (disturbances, regime shifts, alternative stable states, temporal stability, etc.), (h) ecosystem inputs: geology and soils, (i) carbon cycling and carbon budgets, (j) decomposition, (k) nutrient cycling, &nbsp;(l) metacommunities.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>In addition to the papers discussed in class, the following texts are recommended:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Mittelbach GG, McGill BJ (2019) Community ecology, 2nd edn.

A modern biologist can use multiple tools to make sense of data and uncover signals that help describe how the world works.

The discussion topics include replication and pseudoreplication, randomisation, sample size and degrees of freedom, orthogonal design, and non-orthogonal observational data. The topics on statistical modelling include parameter estimation, model prediction, overfitting, collinearity, missing data, approaches to choosing models, and model simplification. This course will be taught through lectures and worksheets using the R programming language. The example datasets used in the worksheets will be from ecological, biomedical, and social sciences.</p>\n\n<p>Statistical modelling is as much art as it is a craft. Students will be encouraged to think about creative ways to model seemingly disparate datasets.

The concept of social exclusion as an analytical framework has become increasingly relevant for an understanding of the notions of environmental inequality, conflicts, rights and justice. The course will capture the social exclusion structures and processes which restrict the access of certain social groups to environmental resources and entitlements. It will explain the different forms of social disadvantage &ndash; in village and community, in land and water, in space and commons, in wilderness and conservation &ndash; that persist, in multiple variants and with different intensity, across societies and nations. It will locate the agency to groups that either guard their domain of privilege or challenge the system of social inequalities and segmentation. Thus, understanding social exclusion as a condition/outcome as well as a dynamic process, the course will also examine some environmental justice movements. The course will also be contextually and temporally embedded. In the north, for example, along with African-Americans, Latino and indigenous people, the focus has been the changing nature of social exclusion in environment. Accordingly, the relevant focus groups are the new social groups, including the immigrants and ethnic groups. By contrast, in the Indian context, the problem is one of the persistent, multiple exclusion of certain social groups like Dalit affecting their basic environmental access and rights.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The course is organized around weekly lectures and discussions based on the readings. Students will be asked to write an essay on one of the topics of the course, with footnotes and bibliography, and further readings will be given to them on their chosen topic, so that they can go in much more depth on a particular topic.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Unit 1: (Week 1): Social Exclusion and Environmental Justice: An Introduction to Conceptual Issues</p>\n\n<p>Unit 2: (Week 2-3): Race, Caste, Class and Environment: Patterns and Processes</p>\n\n<p>Class written assignment</p>\n\n<p>Unit 3: (Week 4-6): Revisiting Village, Community, Water, Commons: Sites of Social Exclusion</p>\n\n<p>Class written assignment</p>\n\n<p>Unit 4: (Week 7-9): Social Exclusion and Environmental Change: Insights in the literature of Jotirao Phule, E.

We then ask to what degree the hypotheses are supported by data in a process we call &lsquo;hypothesis testing&rsquo;. Statistics allows us to quantify this degree of support as probabilities. Crucially, the probabilities can be wrong if the assumptions of statistical tests aren&rsquo;t met. Unfortunately, data commonly encountered in the natural and social sciences often challenge the assumptions of classical statistical methods, increasing the risk of erroneous conclusions being drawn. The course introduces students to advanced statistical techniques to address such challenges. Additionally, the course introduces students to multivariate statistical methods that can be used to analyze multi-dimensional data, which is frequently encountered in most scientific disciplines. Students will receive a boost to their data analysis skills and greater confidence to tackle complex, messy, real-world data and the rigorous peer-review process of many journals.</p>\n\n<p>This course is suitable for advanced undergraduate and graduate level students. Initial lectures will recap basic statistical concepts and methods and R programming to bring everyone up to speed. Course topics include Generalized Linear Models (GLM), strategies for detecting and fixing GLM assumption violations, Generalized Least Squares (GLS), Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM), Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), simulation-based methods, Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA), Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS), Redundancy Analysis (RDA), and multivariate regression.</p>\n\n<p>To make concepts easier to grasp, examples will be drawn from the natural and social sciences that reflect the students&rsquo; interests, e.g., (a) using a GLMM to test the hypothesis that phosphorous content in lake water affects phytoplankton biomass, (b) using RDA on genomic data to identify which environmental variables drive spatial patterns of genetic variation, and (c) using CART to find the most important socio-economic predictors of maternal distress in low-income households. Students can bring datasets and questions; these will be jointly analyzed to illustrate the decision-making process.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Zuur A, Ieno EN, Walker N, Saveliev AA, Smith GM (2009) Mixed effects models and extensions in ecology with R.

In turn, the political, ideological and social essence of ecological problems is manifested by deeply contrasting visions of what structuring society according to nature might mean. Taking a historical approach, the course will strengthen the interaction of natural and social sciences in understanding contemporary environmental politics.

This FC takes up key dimensions of the contemporary debate on the human environment with special attention to the challenges in the developing countries.</p>\n\n<p>This includes issues as diverse as human demographic expansions, the impact of new technologies to hoe issues of ecology and environment relate to gender and nation. No discussion could today be complete without a sense of how humans relate to other species on the planet and to the larger global challenges such as climate change.</p>\n\n<p>We do focus case studies of when, why, and how states or societies responded to these challenges and what the outcomes , intended or unintended were. The idea is to pose dilemmas and encourage critical thought. What is the best way to save endangered species and why do so at all? Can new knowledge inform public debate in positive ways and when? Is population expansion a bane or boon? How is it best to view big dams or the Green Revolution?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The idea is to learn to think not what to think. And to so vis a vis the environment can be exciting as it will unpack many premises. Each window will open new horizons.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The course aims to equip the student to ask and consider issues of the environment in a nuanced, holistic, and critical manner. It is not aimed at one-off so-called solutions and will actively encourage all to take apart, and unpack the question before we define any answer.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge of having a productive, safe, habitable, and biologically productive environment touches on all literally all fields of human knowledge and endeavour. A brief Foundation Course cannot possibly cover even a fraction. But is the place to begin to see how the parts relate to the whole.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>There will be three&nbsp;basic books used</p>\n\n<p>Sectrions will be given to read and discuss, Other readings will be papers and chapters all given in soft copy at the start of the term.</p>\n\n<p>1.

Most so why.</p>\n\n<p>Twenty-five per cent marks are for participation: there will be a note written and submitted end of term.</p>\n\n<p>During term there will be short notes in class ( not graded and only 100 or 250 words each) and these will be handed in on the spot though not graded these will be vital to help learn how to frame arguments.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Attendance in class&nbsp;is a must.

All are encouraged to take part by asking or speaking and given the complexity of the subject please be clear curiosity is encouraged. There will be adequate opportunity for all but to take part trning up in class, doing the readings is a must.</p>\n\n<p>Non attendance in DS will be taken very seirously.,</p>\n\n<p>There are no penalties for absence but the way you write may get aversely affected by not having experience of class.</p>\n</div></div>",

There are more people in our country than in any other in the world. At a very basic level this demonstrates an ability to stay alive and multiply. In other words, to understand and care for human bodies. There are, therefore, few better vantage points than our understandings of human bodies and health through which to explore the contours, characteristics, and even the plausibility of an &lsquo;Indian civilization&rsquo;. Have there been particular civilizational ways to think about human bodily health? If so, what are these and how best to understand them? These are the main questions we will explore in this course.</p>\n\n<p>To answer the questions, we will delve into over two millennia of medical ideas and practices in region. We will learn about the classical Sanskrit works of Caraka and Susruta, the Persianate canon of Ibn Sina, the birth of modern pandemics during the British Raj, heart transplants in postcolonial India and, finally, the profits and privations around the patenting of medicinal herbs like neem.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the course, students will acquire a broad sense of both Indian history in general and, more specifically, the history of medicine. They will further acquire critical tools for thinking about the role of specialized technical knowledge within society. Additionally, the course will also hone critical thinking and writing skills.</p>\n</div></div>",

How far back in time do we have to travel in order to discover it? Starting from the dawn of history and taking a long view of the past, how can we make sense of the seemingly endless detail, the bewildering variety and uneven textures, the striking continuities shot through by even more striking changes? Does civilization reveal itself in the everyday rhythms of life of village folk, city dwellers or forest tribes? Is it represented in artefacts or ideas, in simple objects or grand monuments, in folk songs or classical literature? This course answers such questions by looking at Indian civilization through the coexistence of contradictions. We will see the coexistence of unequal societies with promises of salvation for all; of social prudery with a celebration of sexuality; of misogyny with the worship of goddesses; of religions preaching nonviolence with a politics marked by war and violence; of religious dialogue with religious conflict; of an inward-lookingness despite centuries of lively interactions with the world. By exploring such contradictions, the course will show that the past is neither dead nor dull, and that we need to understand it in order to understand our present and ourselves.</p>\n</div></div>",

Is this deeply loved sport that evokes tremendous passion, comradery, friction, and rivalry across South Asia, a part of Indian civilization? Many believe that cricket is a religion in India. But there is no doubt that this sport (or religion if you like) was invented by the British and came to South Asia via colonialism. How we answer the question of cricket&rsquo;s place in Indian civilization, then, shows the variety of ways in which we conceptualize both civilization and India. Our answer is also most likely to suggest that for the idea of civilization to have traction, it must be grounded in some notion of territory, culture, and history. This course therefore is about how territory, culture, and history came together in specific ways to make Indian civilization thinkable in today&rsquo;s day and age. Further, this course deliberates on&nbsp;where and when Indian&nbsp;civilization&nbsp;began&nbsp;and where and when it&nbsp;ends.&nbsp;It asks what is&nbsp;so Indian&nbsp;about Indian civilization? It explores the relationships between Indian civilization and some of South Asia&rsquo;s economic, political, and social potentialities and limitations. And most importantly, it considers the stakes involved in posing and answering the central questions that motivate this course. This foundation course (FC) is divided into two modules:&nbsp;Where&nbsp;is Indian Civilization?&nbsp;Why&nbsp;Europe Grew Rich But India Did Not? The first module explores historical processes that make South Asia and India a recognizable entity today. The second module introduces students to key perspectives on the&nbsp;nature&nbsp;of Indian civilization and its impact on India&rsquo;s economic, political, and social trajectories from 1600 onwards.</p>\n\n<p>This foundation course will&nbsp;challenge the ways students look at the past, and through it, the present and the future.</p>\n</div></div>",

In addition, mathematicians, and those who apply mathematics---physicists, computer-scientists, economists, and others---spend a lot of time learning mathematics and seeing whether it applies to their own work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This course will be on experimental mathematics. The experimentation will be done using commonly available math packages and calculators, such as sage and desmos, and of course by hand. &nbsp; We will learn how to understand mathematics and experience some of the joys of finding patterns, as well as learn some strategies on how we can prove our discoveries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the course, I expect students to gain an appreciation for mathematics, learn something about its culture, and experience the joy that accompanies a creative idea. This course should be useful for people who expect to use mathematics and computation&nbsp;in their work; for example, students pursuing&nbsp;Math, sciences including Biology, Computer Science, Economics, Finance,&nbsp;Psychology&nbsp;and Political Science.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>No prior knowledge of mathematics (other than what is covered in middle school) is required. No prior knowledge of programming is required. It is expected that students who are comfortable with mathematics (or programming) will help others who are not so comfortable with math (resp. programming).&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>At the end of this course, you should be able to use freely available&nbsp;visualization and computational tools to be able to engage with mathematical ideas and formulas. We will be covering a wide variety of topics and ideas. You will be assigned a book to read, based on your interests. That will help you get something unique from this course.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>We will use the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Google Classroom.</li>\n\t<li>Graphing Calculator: <a href=\"https://www.desmos.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.desmos.com</a></li>\n\t<li>Sage. A symbolic algebra package available at <a href=\"https://www.sagemath.org\">https://www.sagemath.org</a>.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>A book will be assigned for reading to you depending on your individual goals and needs.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The following is tentative breakup of marks and activities.</p>\n\n<p>1. <strong>Projects 1-10:</strong> (20 marks each = 200 Marks).&nbsp; &nbsp;No makeups. You may work in groups in class but submit your own. If you don&#39;t come to class, you will miss these.&nbsp;<br />\nThese will be handed out, discussed, and collected in the class. Miss the classes and miss the project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Portfolio:&nbsp;</strong>(100 marks). You are expected to maintain a portfolio during the course. This includes your lecture notes and any other items you have learned and liked in the course. Ramanujan famously maintained his &quot;Notebooks&quot;, where he recorded his discoveries. &nbsp;You may wish to make one of your own, where you include items you learned from the course and from the book assigned to you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Final</strong>:&nbsp;(100 marks) There will be an in-class final based on the math covered in the projects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Group score</strong>: (100 marks) will be given to you will be the average of your group&#39;s project score scaled to 100. If you do not interact with your group members, the group may request me to throw you out of the group, in which case you will get a 0 for this part.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Grades</strong>&nbsp;While we cannot promise this will happen, plan as per the following. Total score: 90%-100%: A, A- (excellent); 80s: B&#39;s (good); 70s: C&#39;s (average) and so on.&nbsp; To pass, you will have to show reasonable effort in your portfolio, and reasonable competency in your final exam.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>There is an&nbsp;attendance policy. If you don&#39;t come, you miss the assignment of the day. There will be no make-ups given. No delays allowed. So it is advised that you take this course only if you are sure you have the time in your busy schedule to attend ALL the classes and do all the work.&nbsp; It is expected you will spend time with your group outside of class, but the bulk of the work is to be done in the class, with the help of your group.&nbsp; Attendance will be taken and used in determining your&nbsp;group score.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

More recently, exposures to supply chain shocks arising from the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war have also ignited questions over whether cross-border economic integration has gone too far, with many countries now explicitly pursuing policies aimed at on-shoring or near-shoring critical supply chains. Coupled with increasing demand for critical minerals to support the green transition, deep consideration of the benefits and risks of global value chains is ever more pressing.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This course seeks to provide an analytical understanding&nbsp;of the global environment and policy challenges in open economies in trade, finance and labour markets.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The course will focus on books by Jagdish Bhagwati (In Defense of Globalization), Joseph Stiglitz (Globalization and its Discontents), Dani Rodrik (The Globalization Paradox), and the OECD (Interconnected Economies: Benefiting from Global Value Chains).

The very notions of economy, politics and society that we take for granted were conceptualized and transmuted with the onset and development of modernity. This course offers an introduction to the key texts and thinkers of modern social theory as well as the concomitant rise of the modern state, democracy and capitalism. In particular, it aims at probing the relationship between the theories and institutions of modernity. In so doing, this course intends to ground students in the conceptual and historical foundations of contemporary social sciences.</p>\n\n<p>This course assumes no prior knowledge of economics, political science or sociology&mdash;only a willingness to read original texts that defy disciplinary boundaries and understand their historical context. The course is designed to make you engage closely with original texts. We will focus on one key thinker each week and you will be provided excerpts from their writings. The amount of reading assigned has been calibrated according to the difficulty of the text (in style as well as substance). In many weeks you will be given no more than 30 pages &ndash; but do not assume that you can read these as quickly as other academic literature. I have deliberately refrained from directing you to secondary literature. But if you are interested in learning more about the background and wider work of these thinkers&mdash;we will be fiercely selective in what we cover in the class&mdash;I would advise you to start with Oxford University Press&rsquo;s Very Short Introduction series, which covers all the figures we will read.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Each week, I will deliver two lectures focusing on the historical context to the thinkers and on their main conceptual contribution to our understanding of the modern politics, economy and society. These will be followed by Discussion Sections with your TFs, which will focus more closely on the texts assigned.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Reading List</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Week 1: Introduction and Hobbes</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thomas Hobbes, <em>Leviathan</em>, Ch. 13, 17, 18.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week 2: Rousseau</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jean-Jacques Rousseau, <em>Discourse on the Origin and Foundation of Inequality Among Men</em>, Part II.</p>\n\n<p>Idem, <em>On the Social Contract</em>, Bk I, Ch. 1-3, 5-8; Bk II, Ch. 1-4.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week 3: Smith</strong></p>\n\n<p>Adam Smith, <em>Wealth of Nations</em>, Introduction, Bk I, Ch. 1-2, 7; Bk III, Ch. 1.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week 4: Hegel</strong></p>\n\n<p>G.W.F.

Narrative coherence is somewhat looser, though should be devoid of inconsistencies. It should also offer a compelling answer to your question.

On a par with the external world, the inner world of the self is so complicated and multidimensional that can, and indeed should, be studied by diverse branches of philosophy and science. Among other scholars, philosophers have always been tackling puzzlements about the nature of the human self. Some of the fundamental philosophical questions include: what is the nature of the mind and the mental states? What is the relation between mind and body? How can we best understand certain mental characteristics like consciousness? Can AIs be conscious? How do our minds affect our behaviours? Are we really free in at least some of our behaviours? How can we be justified in believing in other minds?</p>\n\n<p>In this course, we shall explore such problems and examine the main philosophical theories offered as solutions. Though we will occasionally discuss ancient, medieval and modern views, our focus will be on the views of contemporary analytic philosophers. By the end of our intellectual journey, I expect you to get familiar with some of the mysteries of our &ldquo;inner world&rdquo; and become strongly encouraged to enhance your relevant knowledge in future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Course Objectives</p>\n\n<p>The aim of this course is to:</p>\n\n<p>Articulate an overview of philosophical issues related to the course topic</p>\n\n<p>Practice critical analysis and evaluation of philosophical theories</p>\n\n<p>Engage in reasoned and charitable philosophical discourse about the relevant issues with the class community</p>\n\n<p>Become familiar with the methodology of philosophy</p>\n\n<p>Develop expository writing skills.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Required Readings:</p>\n\n<p>Neil Campbell, <em>A Brief Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind</em>, Broadview Press, 2005 (NC)</p>\n\n<p>Jack S.

What does it mean to love and care for oneself and for others? What allows us to love and care? What prevents us from caring and loving ourselves and others? What forces&mdash;personal, interpersonal, or collective and communal&mdash;regulate, prescribe and even prohibit experiences and expressions of love. As the narrator in Arundhati Roy&rsquo;s <em>The God of Small Things</em> poignantly reflects, such questions are older than any conception we might have of &ldquo;history,&rdquo; and comprise at times unspoken and often unwritten &ldquo;Love Laws&rdquo; that determine who can be loved, how and how much.</p>\n\n<p>Our primary goal in the course is to work towards developing a critical and comprehensive language around understanding care and love as the basis for any and all configurations of relationalities that both make and unmake our senses of being in the world. Beginning our journey with selections from <em>The Symposium</em> by Plato, verses from the <em>Gatha Sattasai</em>, and poetry from the <em>Akam</em> repertoire of Sangam literature, we will make our way through more contemporary iterations and meditations on caring and loving such as, Roland Barthes&rsquo; <em>A Lover&rsquo;s Discourse</em> and Ocean Vuong&rsquo;s <em>On Earth We Are Briefly Gorgeous</em>. All along the way we will be reflecting on and attempting to problematize &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; and &ldquo;normative&rdquo; structures within which care and love are usually understood and experienced.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This is a tentative Assessment Rubric:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>#CareandLove #ALoveLikeThat: 20 points</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Over the course of the semester, you will be sharing a total of 10 posts on a Social Media platform of your choosing. These posts must be shared the aforementioned hashtag(s). You will be compiling screenshots of these posts in a single word document. Each post must be consecutive over the weeks of the semester, show a clear time-stamp and be followed by a 2-3 sentence blurb.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Short Reflections: 15 points</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You will be writing 3 short reflections of 150-200 words each. These will be based on the readings and our conversations in class and in the Discussion Sessions and will emphasize your experience of reading the texts being discussed.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Midterm Essay: 10 points</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You will be writing a 500-750-word essay (2-3 double-spaced pages). The topic/prompt will be discussed in class ahead of time. The midterm will then be peer reviewed and workshopped to be expanded into your final essay for the course.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Final Essay: 20 points</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The final essay will be a 1250-1500-word essay (5-6 double-spaced pages), and will be a revised and enlarged version of the midterm.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Symposium: 15 Points</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You will be required to participate in a Symposium styled loosely after the one Plato narrates in his text, the theme for which will be &ldquo;A Love Like That&rdquo;. Details will be shared in class.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Attendance and Participation: 20 points</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Our classes will be a mix of activities, discussions, and short lectures. As stated in the previous section of this syllabus, attendance and active participation in class are crucial to your success in this course. To such an end up to a total of 20% of your final grade will be based on your presence in and contributions to our conversations in class. Please note, when we use the word &ldquo;present&rdquo; in the context of this course, we do not merely mean your physical presence in class.&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Attendance Policy and Class Conduct</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>On Attendance:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Attendance is mandatory. You are, however, allowed a maximum of three excused absences over the course of the semester. Each additional absence will cost you 5 points on your final grade. Accommodations or considerations, should they be necessary, will only be made on a per case basis.</li>\n\t<li>Attendance will be taken every class period.</li>\n\t<li>Tardiness, for our purposes, will be defined as arriving later than ten minutes after the start of class. Five instances of tardiness will be counted as one absence.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>On Reading and Notetaking:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>All assigned texts must be brought to class in either printed or electronic form.</li>\n\t<li>All assigned readings must be completed in a timely manner.</li>\n\t<li>You are strongly encouraged to take notes on in-class lectures and discussions, and on the assigned texts as you read them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>On the Use of Electronic Devices:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>You are allowed the use of electronic devices such as laptops, tablets or your phones only to access readings or materials relevant to classwork and for note taking.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>On Participation:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>It will be our effort to ensure that our classroom is a space where everybody feels free and safe and has the time to participate.</li>\n\t<li>You are encouraged to ask questions and express your thoughts freely and openly in class, however, do be mindful of the impact your words have.</li>\n\t<li>Extend your kindness and hospitality to one another.

Literature allows us more wide-ranging lives and selves beyond the possibilities of our own self-narratives. As we read about how literary characters narrate and navigate themselves in the world, we&rsquo;ll also gain a closer understanding of ourselves as readers, navigating the literary and the material world.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Our primary task will be to think about how literary characters undertake self-narrative.&nbsp; How do literary characters define themselves? When and why do they surprise themselves? How does the self-story of literary characters occur in concert with the world? &nbsp;How does the characters backdrop&mdash;their culture and geography condition the self? Is the self that is evoked in nature different from the self that is evoked in the city? What is conveyed by the backdrop of snow or a river, by Japan or Columbia?</p>\n\n<p>Once a literary character has dreamed up a self, they have to live, love, and meet the world with themselves.&nbsp; This opens up a range of other questions. When does the self feel insufficient or excessive? How do experiences like desire, rage, love, and ageing affect the self? What do literary characters do when they feel oppressed by themselves? &nbsp;Above all, what language is available for these inner experiences?</p>\n\n<p>We will explore these themes and questions with the overarching goal of growing as readers.&nbsp; By the end of the course, you will not only have read some great literary works from across the world, you will also have honed your capacity to listen for psychological themes across literary works.&nbsp; Your mid-term and final papers are designed to help you develop from readers of the plot to producers of ideas&mdash;they&rsquo;ll give you a chance to forward your own perspective on what is conjured up by and contained in the literary works we read.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><ul>\n\t<li>To become attentive to how characters in a novel discover themselves and form a self-narrative.</li>\n\t<li>To recognize how language in great literary works offers a vehicle for self-description and self-discovery</li>\n\t<li>To read bodies not as purely biological machines but as a theaters of self-experience. &nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>To know ourselves as readers of literature&mdash;how do we love, hate and despair within the frame of a novel? Which of a novel&rsquo;s characters do we identify with? What does that tell us about ourselves? &nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>To read books as vehicles for ideas; to identify what kind of ideas any given novel seems to be promoting (what kind of a dream is this?) and the perspective it represents, as well as other perspectives it might jostle against.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Primary Texts</p>\n\n<p>Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There by Lewis Carrol (Penguin Classics, 1998)&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Brave New World by Aldous Huxley (1932)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Smell (short story) by Sadat Hasan Manto</p>\n\n<p>Sakuntala (play by Kalidasa, Barbara Stoller-Miller translation)</p>\n\n<p>Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe, 1958 (Everyman&rsquo;s Library, 2010)</p>\n\n<p>Three Short Stories by Jorge Luis Borges: The Library of Babel, Tl&ouml;n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius and The Circular Ruins translated by Andrew Hurley, in Fictions, p. 44-50 (Penguin Modern Classics, 1998)</p>\n\n<p>The Headstrong Historian by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (short story in That Thing Around Your Neck, 2009)</p>\n\n<p>Hardboiled by Banana Yoshimoto&nbsp;(novella in Hardboiled &amp; Hard Luck, 1999)</p>\n\n<p>The Death of Ivan Ilyich by Leo Tolstoy (Roland Wilks, trans.)</p>\n\n<p>The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde (Penguin Classics)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Films</p>\n\n<p>Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016). 1 Hr 53 mins</p>\n\n<p>The Enemy (2013) 1 Hr 30 mins</p>\n\n<p>Certified Copy (2010) 1 Hr 46 mins</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>1.

We will read novels, short stories, memoirs and essays to discover that each of these works of art were responsible for protesting against the injustices of their times.

In this course we will learn how they do so in astronomy and cosmology, which are different from physics in one fundamental respect: in physics we can do experiments to test our hypotheses, but in astronomy and cosmology we cannot. Fortunately, the fundamental laws of physics, tested through Earth-based experiments, have been applicable to the entire universe since the beginning (so far as we can tell). This point is important because we can see the universe only as it was in the past, since all information-bearing signals &mdash; in particular light, the most important of signals &mdash; must travel at finite speed. Thus the signals received from an object record not the present but the moment in the past when they were emitted. When combined with the vast distances that separate objects in the universe, this leads to the astonishing conclusion that a deep snapshot of the universe from any point taken &ldquo;at any moment&rdquo; is actually a snapshot of the history of the universe. We might ask why information cannot be transmitted instantaneously. The answer is embedded in the fabric of space and time, which is described by Einstein&rsquo;s special theory of relativity. And the fabric of space and time, we will discover, is modified by the presence of the matter that occupies it. The modification of space and time by matter is the understanding due to Einstein of what we normally call the force of gravity. But of course gravity, as we all know, was first understood by Newton; so we start there.</p>\n\n<p>Newton&rsquo;s version of gravity correctly describes familiar phenomena like the motion of planets around the Sun. What is less obvious is that gravity can be used to discover planets. This method was first used to discover Neptune, and has been used extensively to discover exoplanets, i.e. planets outside the solar system. In the first part of this course we will figure out how exoplanets can be revealed by Newton&rsquo;s theory of gravity, and in the process learn how it and physics work. In the second part of the course, we will understand how the nature of space and time results in a maximum speed for all signals. In the third part we will talk briefly about the way in which massive objects, for example black holes, modify the space-time around them. And in the final part we will try to understand how the universe &mdash; i.e. space-time with all that it contains &mdash; has evolved since the beginning and how it may end.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Learning how science works, and, in the process, learning how amazing our universe is.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Pre-requisites: None.</p>\n\n<p>Books and online resources: No books.

We will talk mostly about the equity market, but later we will also discuss options (puts &amp; calls). The course revolves around different models, methods, and approaches that <em>might</em>&nbsp;help us identify mispriced financial assets which in turn <em>could</em> help us design a reasonably good portfolio. These methods and models have some kind of economic or accounting rationale behind&nbsp;them and some of them are based on groundbreaking papers published in the last century. Despite all that, a student in this course would eventually come to realize that no one model/ method is enough to help us understand the true value of a financial asset. In fact, it is extremely hard to explain why a given object has a particular value and check whether that object is overpriced/ underpriced. Renowned statistician, George Box once said - &quot;all models are wrong, but some are useful&quot;. That is what we will try to do in this course - study some models that have been useful in the context of asset pricing. To be specific, we will start with a modern interpretation of Talmudic investing strategy, Markowitz portfolio selection (and maybe some of the later&nbsp;variants if time or your interest permits), factor/ index models, capital asset pricing model (CAPM), and its variants, arbitrage pricing theory, Fama-French three-factor model (maybe briefly discuss the more recent 5-factor model), efficient market hypothesis, equity valuation models, and later we will study options, put-call parity, Black-Scholes&#39; options pricing.<br />\n<br />\nThis is a rigorous course, a math-based, statistics-based course. If such things tire you, if you are looking for storytelling, a case-studies-based approach, then this course is probably not for you.

Managing an international business or one exposed to global competition requires an understanding of international financial instruments, markets, and institutions. This course seeks to provide a working knowledge of these issues. The stress will be on an understanding of the intuition behind the theories, not on mathematical proofs or on replicating empirical results from the literature. The course will not shy away from complex ideas but will try to make the ideas as accessible as possible. Solving mathematical financial problems is an important part of the course.</p>\n\n<p>The course will address the following main topics: national income accounting and balance of payments; global economic developments and outlook; growth and slowdown of globalization; international financial systems; foreign exchange market and exchange rate determination; foreign currency derivative instruments; arbitrage and international parity conditions; risks in global finance (e.g., foreign exchange risk and country risk), and the management of foreign exchange risk with forwards and options.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Students will develop a strong foundation to follow economic developments across countries and recognize their interlinkages and spillovers.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>There will be no single required text book for the course. Recommended books include:</p>\n\n<p>International Finance: Theory and Policy by Paul R.

There will be no make-up quizzes or make-up exam for any reason. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The overall grade for the course will be the aggregate scores of the six quizzes (60% of the grade) and mid-term&nbsp;exam (40% of the grade). If a student misses any quiz or exam, she/he will be marked a zero score for that particular quiz/exam. If you miss any quiz or exam for valid medical reasons, you must provide a certificate from a registered medical practitioner or hospital.</p>\n\n<p>The final letter-grading will be on a curve. The distribution of final grades will be such that no more than 15% will receive an &quot;A&quot; grade, no more than 15% will receive an &quot;A minus grade&quot; and no more than 20% of the class will receive a &quot;B+&quot; grade</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Attendance is not compulsory.

Students will be initiated into learning Persian language and literature from learning the alphabet to the formation of words and sentences in Persian. Learning materials will be provided by the course instructor. Weekly classroom activities are given below:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Persian Alphabet and Script</p>\n\n<p>Persian alphabet consists of 32 letters which are written from right to left. It is a Perso-Arabic script. Students will be taught to write the alphabet. The letters are to be written separately and jointly in which they will change forms.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Formation of Words</p>\n\n<p>Once the students learn the alphabet and script, they will easily use them to form words which is the first step towards learning a language. Besides, they will be introduced to short and long Persian vowels. Separate letters will be given to the students to join them and form words. They must make 100 Persian words from the given letters. The pronunciation and meaning of every word will be explained to them.</p>\n\n<p>Numbers, Names of Days of the week, Months and Seasons</p>\n\n<p>Persian numbers are written from left to right in a similar way as in English. In this class, students will learn to write Persian cardinals and ordinals with proper pronunciation. Further, it will help them to learn the names of days of the week in Persian easily. Students will also learn the names of months and seasons. They will learn to use the numerical also to denote singular and plural nouns.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Possessive Case and Usage of Nouns with Adjectives</p>\n\n<p>In the Persian language personal pronoun plays an important role. It has both long and short form which help learner to identify the subject/object in a sentence. In this class students will be taught to form or connect nouns with adjectives and nouns with nouns. Usage of link (Ezafe) will be taught to the learners to form possessive case or to connect noun with noun and adjective with noun to describe the noun. Students will also learn to use positive comparative and superlative degrees of adjectives. A list of adjectives will be provided to them to build their vocabulary, clauses, and expressions.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Infinitives and Conjugation of Tenses</p>\n\n<p>Grammar or the science of language is essential to learn a language in an easy and systematic way. Persian grammar is limited and easy to learn. It has etymology (sarf) and syntax (nahv) which help the learners to identify words and write sentences grammatically correct. Persian grammar begins with infinitive (masdar) which is considered as &ldquo;mother of words&rdquo;. Infinitive begets different forms of a word. They also enable to form tenses- Present, Past and Future. The verbs also correspond with subject. Therefore, verbs and nouns will be taught together and in this way etymology and syntax will go hand in hand.</p>\n\n<p>In this class students will learn to form past tense in Persian. All the types of past tense are formed by a simple manner and easy to learn method. Persian infinitives (masadir) provide forms of past tenses. Students will be provided with a list of infinitives (masadir) in the class and their meaning will be explained to them. They will have to memorize the infinitives (masadir) which will help them to form sentences in various past tenses.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Conjugating Present Tense</p>\n\n<p>Present tense in Persian is formed by using the present stem of verb deduced from&nbsp;&nbsp; an infinitive. In this class students will learn to form the present stem from Persian infinitives which help them to form sentences in present tense.</p>\n\n<p>They will be provided with a list of present stems from Persian infinitives. They will memorize them to develop their skill to form sentences in present tense in Persian. The present tenses are simple present and present continuous tense only which are used to convey proverbial, universal and general matters of fact.</p>\n\n<p>Conjugating Future Tense</p>\n\n<p>In this class students will learn to form sentences in future tense. In Persian language there are two types of future tense. Present continuous tense is also used to express future act. However, there is a particular method or usage of word to denote future tense. Students will be taught to use both the forms of future tense in the class and their appropriate usages.</p>\n\n<p>Interrogative, Affirmative, Negative, Interjection and Conjunction</p>\n\n<p>After learning the three forms of tenses of Persian language students will be able to form sentences in various tenses. In this class they will learn to make interrogative sentences in Persian. Students will learn to make the sentences by using different interrogative words. They will also learn to change affirmative sentences into negative. Interjection and conjunction make a sentence expressive and cohesive. A list of words (interjection and conjunction) will be given to the students to use them in their sentences.</p>\n\n<p>Persian Adverbs</p>\n\n<p>In this class students will become familiar with the different types of adverbs used in the Persian language. Adverb of time, place and manner will be used by the students to form sentences.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Persian Prepositions</p>\n\n<p>The link (ezafe) that has been taught in previous class joins two words together. However, there is a list of prepositions in Persian language. Prepositions are necessary to learn in order to make their appropriate usage in sentences. Their usages will make expressions meaningful.</p>\n\n<p>Auxiliary Verbs</p>\n\n<p>Besides learning the main verbs, it is expedient for the learners to know and use auxiliary verbs in Persian. They are an added advantage to a sentence to express ideas in a whole some manner. They are used along with the main verb in a grammatical template. The template will be explained to the students to use auxiliary verbs in a sentence in past, present and future tenses.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Persian Proverbs and Idioms</p>\n\n<p>Proverbs are the condensed form of human wisdom expressed in crisp and clear words in society. Idioms are the way of expression in a language. Proverbs and idioms make a language beautiful, graceful and meaningful. Students will learn</p>\n\n<p>at least 10 to 15 Persian proverbs and 20-25 idioms that will help to develop their linguistic skill.</p>\n\n<p>Composition</p>\n\n<p>Composition, pr&eacute;cis writing and essay help a language learner to express himself in his language. Texts will be provided to the students to comprehend and respond to them and make a precis of them. They will be asked write essays on topic of their choice.</p>\n\n<p>Reading and Translating Persian Text</p>\n\n<p>After learning the basic grammar, students will start reading the Persian texts both poetry and prose. They will be able to translate them into English. Students will be provided easy and simple Persian texts to read and translate them into English. They will improve their reading and comprehension abilities. They will also be encouraged to use Persian dictionary to translate the given texts. In order to develop proficiency in language reading Persian texts and translating them into English on daily basis are recommended. This exercise of reading and translating Persian texts will continue for next five weeks. Different texts will be provided to the students every week to read, comprehend and translate them. To begin with, a poetic text of Nizami Ganjavi will be studied in the class which is simple and easy to understand. It is a hymn written in beautiful and elegant Persian. Text of Nizami&rsquo;s hymn is titled: Be Naam-i-Izad Bakshayendeh (In the Name of God the Merciful) compiled in Farsi wa Dastur by Zahra Khanleri will be provided to the students.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>At the end of the course students will have a basic understanding of the Persian language and they will be able to read, write and understand basic Persian texts</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Reading materials will be provided in the class</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Three Monthly Tests of 25 Marks each (Marks of the best two shall be considered for the final grading)</p>\n\n<p>Final End Semester Exam of 50 Marks (Oral &amp; Written)</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Not more than 2 absences are allowed&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

Some of the important milestones in this journey include an introduction to human evolution, cultural and technological transitions in prehistory leading to the consolidation of food production, efflorescence of Harappan culture as the first urban civilization, diversity of non-Harappan Chalcolithic cultures, proliferation of state systems coinciding with what is identified as &#39;second urbanization&#39;, and the transformation of one such state into a trans-regional empire. By incorporating new research in the field, the course delves into exciting themes such as historical traditions of early India, social stratification and cultural identities, kingship and visions of empire, and India&#39;s linkages with the wider world through trade and politico-diplomatic exchanges.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>There are no prerequisites&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>BASIC REFERENCE BOOKS</p>\n\n<p>1.

It has three main objectives, viz. sensitize students to the ways in which history saturates our lives, introduce students to the full spectrum of themes studied by historians, and finally, to acquaint students with the fundamental tools of historical analysis. We will touch upon a wide range of themes in the course ranging from the history of computers to the history-writing itself and from the history of cricket to time. This is because the course is intended to be more of an introduction, than a comprehensive discussion of any single subject. At the level of analytical tools, the course will introduce students to key distinctions between history/ memory, primary/ secondary sources, fact/ narratives etc. These will be tools and vocabulary that history students would keep encountering in all other courses they take in the subject. This latter part of the course will also be more hands-on than the earlier part. Finally, it is worth noting that the course is thematically organized and therefore will include both Indian and non-Indian topics. No pre-existing knowledge of either of the themes or regions is necessary for taking the course.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/0c2e12a7-8200-4052-bd6a-c868f9356806.pdf' download='History MattersDec2023.pdf'>History MattersDec2023.pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

Human-landscape interaction and how changing socio-politics influenced such interaction? To what extent major climatic events influenced culture change and the expression of social complexities?

It will focus on some of the dominant traditions of historical writing, and the internal dialogues within the traditions. It will move from positivism to critical theory, from Marxism to the Annales, from the French historical tradition to English social history, from histories of the economy to histories of sensibilities and emotion, from Foucault&rsquo;s discursive turn to Michel de Certeau&rsquo;s focus on everyday practice. Through this journey, we will reflect on some of the binaries that often shape historical thinking &ndash;&ndash; the questions of history and myth, certainty and ambiguity, objectivity and prejudice, truth and falsehood &ndash;&ndash; and see how these notions are questioned and rethought over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If historians in the nineteenth century established some of the founding premises of the historian&rsquo;s craft, the &lsquo;critical turn&rsquo; from the 1970s has powerfully questioned many of these assumptions, underlining the complex nature of historical practice. It has persuaded historians to ask: what does it mean to enter the archive and mine the traces of the past, to read the record, to see and represent, to narrate, and to write a story based on evidence? This course will explore what this critical turn has meant to the writing of history, how it has forced historians to question earlier frames, opening up new worlds of research, and how the old questions of historical evidence and verification still remain critical to the historian&rsquo;s craft.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/a4df1f7c-ee04-48c0-9f7b-312755592fdc.docx' download='*Reading History Course outline -2024.docx'>*Reading History Course outline -2024.docx</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

It may seem obvious that each nation state, and there are now nearly 200 of them, four time as many as in 1914 on the eve of the Great War, each had a flag , a territory, and an anthem. Yet many also have a symbol of nature identified with them. the bison is national animal of the USA but it got protection only when driven to the edge of extinction often by the very classes that had led its slaughter. The tiger is national animal of six Asian nations, and got such status in 1972 in India and new born Bangladesh at the same time. Why does this matter in terms of policies and attitudes and who decides which animal or bird, river or tree, mountain or sea is national or not.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>More seriously, can nature seen as living space be seen in a uniform way in diverse complex societies with different interest groups, economic or cultural political and social. Nazi Germany valued oaks and wolves, but its obsession with race purity even led to attempts to breed back an extinct wild ox the auroch as symbol of strength. In a very different ways the European bison in post-1918 Poland and in newly independent Angola after 1974, the giant sable antelope was seen as symbol of freedom after long era of alien rule. National parks were symbols of nature and settler culture in apartheid South Africa but while securing Kruger park 1926 on the locked out the black majority: similar processes had unfolded with American Indian peoples in many famous US parks,</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Does the nation preserve nature or enclose it? Is preservation an act of destruction? Why decides and how what is to stay or not. After all nation states measure power not only via army size but also gross domestic product. What happens if drives for more production come at cost of forests, rivers or wildlife or forms of living in conflict with such plans? This course explores how to think about these.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This is designed to look at comparative histories of different countries but is open to all students of natural and social sciences, the humanities, and economics. It is a seminar with readings . An exploration of questions that excite as much as they provoke thought.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The student who does this course will have a critical and informed approach to the changing ways in which nature and nation are inter related. These vary greatly depending on place, time, and context: by placing these in comparative light we gain a better sense of the ways the 20th century world was reshaped often in unintended ways. The course draws on history and ecology, art and science, politics, and literature via a series of case studies. It is hoped that after this a student will see the relations in&nbsp; more nuanced and complex ways.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The reading list will be shared as class assembles. All readings are will be given on folder to all students.</p>\n\n<p>Books for review in the latter part, two per student will also be available as all are in the library and there will be adequate time to study , make a presentation&nbsp; show a draft and then submit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Twenty five percent is for participation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>75 per cent is for take home essays, three in all but two&nbsp;book reviews mandatory.

We will consider what questions these problems raise for historians&#39; use of textual sources by looking at writing as a social, material, and political act. What were the symbolic meanings attributed to writings that most people could not understand? What practical uses could writing serve? How did access to writing intersect with other social hierarchies, like gender and class?

In contemporary imaginations, mountains are essential for the planet&rsquo;s survival and indeed our own physical and mental health. But this was not always the case. In pre-modern Europe, for example, mountains were either ignored or depicted in literature as ugly deformities that scarred the Earth&rsquo;s surface. Why did Europeans think of mountains as ugly? How, when, and why did their aesthetic imaginations change to a point where someone like the celebrated polymath John Ruskin could write that &ldquo;mountains are the beginning and the end of all scenery&rdquo;? How did European perceptions of mountains differ from that of the peoples and traditions of South Asia and elsewhere? And what role has South Asian history played in shaping modern human relationships with the mountains?</p>\n\n<p>This course will take students on a journey from early Asia and pre- modern Europe, to the eighteenth-century when the Alps emerged as objects of adventure, veneration, and scientific experimentation, which in turn, kickstarted two new modern practices&mdash; mountain tourism and the world&rsquo;s most literary sport, mountaineering. This course will then explore how these practices were deeply imbricated with colonialism, nationalism, fascism, and masculinity in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. The course will end in the late twentieth century where it will focus on commercialization of mountaineering and on issues pertaining to non-European modernity. In other words, this course will take students on a journey from a stage in human history where mountains were at best the abode of gods and spirits, and, at worst, ugly deformities, to a stage where there are now &ldquo;traffic jams&rdquo; on Mount Everest.</p>\n\n<p>Focused on the Alps and the Himalaya, this interdisciplinary course will offer a new and exciting vantage point for learning about several fundamental issues and concepts in history and the humanities. Students will learn how scholars in the humanities have rehabilitated mountains as a key terrain where modernity is performed, its limits are exposed, and occasionally transcended. They will also learn about the extent to which our knowledge of the world is framed from the perspective of those who live in the &ldquo;lowlands.&rdquo; Overall, this course will motivate students to think of the history of human interactions with mountains as vital for making sense of what it means to be modern, and, for understanding how we got there.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Tenative Course Syllabus</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><u><strong>Module I: A Cultural History of Mountains</strong></u></p>\n\n<p><u>Week 1: Mountains in Pre-Modern European Imagination and World History</u></p>\n\n<p>Marjorie Hope Nicholson <em>Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory: The Development of the Aesthetics of the Infinite,</em> pp. 34-71.</p>\n\n<p>James Scott <em>The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland South Asia</em> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009), pp. 127-177.</p>\n\n<p><u>Week 2: Mountains in Pre-modern India</u></p>\n\n<p>Kalidasa, <em>Meghaduta</em> excerpts</p>\n\n<p>Kalidasa, <em>Kumarasambhava</em>, excerpts</p>\n\n<p>Nachiket Chanchani <em>Mountain Temples and Temple Mountains: Architecture, Religion and Nature in Central Himalaya</em>, pp. 25-74.</p>\n\n<p><u>Week 3: Scared Mountain in Early to Middle China</u></p>\n\n<p>Wei- Cheng Lin, <em>Building A Sacred Mountain: The Buddhist Architecture of China&rsquo;s Mount Wutai</em>, pp. 51-88.</p>\n\n<p>Wen-shing Chou <em>Mount Wutai Vision of a Sacred Buddhist Mountain</em>, excerpts</p>\n\n<p><u>Week 4: Environment and Aesthetics in Modern Europe</u></p>\n\n<p>Marjorie Hope Nicholson <em>Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory: The Development of The Aesthetics of the Infinite</em> pp. 324-369.</p>\n\n<p>Allen Carlson <em>Nature and Landscape: An Introduction to Environmental Aesthetics,</em> chapter 1, pp. 1-37.</p>\n\n<p>Jon Mathieu, &ldquo;The Sacralization of Mountains in Europe during the Modern Age&rdquo; <em>Mountain Research and Development</em>, 26 (4), pp. 343-349</p>\n\n<p><u>Week 5: Three interpretations of Change in European Attitudes towards the Mountains</u></p>\n\n<p>Marjorie Hope Nicholson <em>Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory: The Development of The Aesthetics of the Infinite </em>pp. 271-323.</p>\n\n<p>Peter Hansen <em>The Summits of the Modern Man: Mountaineering After Enlightenment</em> pp. 30-60.</p>\n\n<p>B.

Why did the Qing emperors of China spend large parts of their reign travelling through their realms? How did the architecture of mosques and tombs articulate the power of the sultans of southern India? Why was astrology important in the functioning of Mughal court society? These are some of the questions this course addresses. It looks at a range of monarchs and their royal courts of the early modern world (1500-1800). The course is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on cases drawn from across the world. It understands kingship in terms of the despotism of the Korean king Chongjo, the gender of the Tudor queen Elizabeth, the power-projection of the Ottoman sultans, the mobility of the Qing emperors of China, and the gifts offered by the kings of Europe. The second part of the course focuses on South Asia as a case study. It analyses in particular kingship and courtly culture in the Mughal Empire, the Rajput kingdoms, the Deccan Sultanates, the Maratha Empire, and various other polities. Through this exploration, the course unravels how monarchs performed their sovereignty, how norms of comportments created and sustained courtly hierarchies, how gardens, palaces, and texts embodied anxieties and authority of rulers, and so on. By the end of the course, students will have a sound idea about the complex workings of kingship and the dynamics of court society in the early modern world.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: This is a History Elective cross-listed with Political Science.

For example, we will consider how the distant developments of the Cold War were also of relevance in shaping India&rsquo;s position in the world. Furthermore, we will examine how the developments of the Cold War were equally shaped, not just by the two superpowers, but also by smaller, poorer, and recently decolonized countries. Enabling an evaluation of why developments unfolded in the way that they did during the Cold War, therefore, the course will show how the appraisal of events from more than a single point of view, is necessary in order to more fully understand the impact of the Cold War on present day international politics.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we will ask: how exactly are these three explanations for understanding how states behave: ideology, institutions, or individuals, to be better analyzed? For instance, even when a decision is &lsquo;ideological&rsquo;, are there ways of further breaking down this explanation? What exactly does an &lsquo;individual&rsquo; decision entail?

The course is structured to acquaint the students with both mainstream and critical approaches to the subject, examining how these theories conceptualize &lsquo;the international&rsquo; as a field of study. The metamorphosis of the global political arena at an unprecedented pace provides a challenge for those who study politics. This course offers protean lenses to read the world: making it intelligible by offering an array of theoretical paradigms. The course is divided into three sections: the first section of <strong>readings review the state of the field and its origins, asking whose voices have dominated IR and whose interests and perspectives they speak</strong>. The second section provides an overview of the <strong>various theoretical frameworks</strong> that have come to define the field. The last section of the course concerns the <strong>future of the discipline </strong>highlighting some of the pertinent debates and questions to be addressed by the discipline. The overall objective of the course is to give students a broad grounding in the wide theoretical terrain of the field and to sensitize students to differences in the nature of knowledge claims (epistemology) and fundamental assumptions about social/international reality (ontology) as well as political and ethical implications of different theoretical approaches in IR.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

The first half of the course has an historical focus, giving students a crash course in developments in Latin American international politics from colonisation to the present day with particular emphasis on the 20th century. In continuation, we look at the influence of China in Latin America, the roles and foreign policies of the region&rsquo;s two largest economies (Mexico and Brazil), and Latin American perspectives on IR theory and practice. In the second half of the course, we turn to important contemporary themes and issues of Latin American international relations (e.g., security, migration, the curious case of Cuba, the rise of authoritarianism, etcetera).</p>\n\n<p>The course does not presume a prior knowledge of Latin American politics, history or economics.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Upon completion of this course students will be able to:</p>\n\n<p>- &nbsp;Explain and analyse the historical trajectory of Latin American states and civil society actors&rsquo; engagement with other parts of the hemisphere and the world;</p>\n\n<p>- &nbsp;Interpret and discuss the various forces driving inter-American relations;</p>\n\n<p>- &nbsp;Analyse the relevance of distinct theoretical traditions in the study of global politics to studying Latin America&rsquo;s role in the world;</p>\n\n<p>- &nbsp;Explain the main Latin American contributions to IR theory;</p>\n\n<p>- &nbsp;Explain and develop an argument about several contemporary issues of Latin American international relations.</p>\n\n<p>- &nbsp;Apply the insights gained from the course readings to produce an essay on a contemporary issue of Latin American international relations.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>See attached syllabus.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Attendance and participation 10%</p>\n\n<p>Presentation 20%</p>\n\n<p>Mid-term exam 30%</p>\n\n<p>Final 3000-word essay&nbsp;40%</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>See attached syllabus.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/c3d61b0c-384f-4d80-b786-45bffede70dd.pdf' download='IR2030 - International Relations of Latin America_Syllabus.pdf'>IR2030 - International Relations of Latin America_Syllabus.pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

How have they been dealt with in response to historical conflicts of global significance?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>- What are the current principles of accountability and mechanisms for enforcing these principles, including truth and reconciliation commissions, international criminal tribunals, and legal actions by third-party countries?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>- Does international aid help states to protect civilians, engage in hearts and minds, or build military coercive capacities?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>- How do states that receive peacekeeping to end conflict fare differently in terms of long-term violent outcomes than those that don&rsquo;t?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>- Why do some rebel groups translate into political parties, while others don&rsquo;t? What are the impacts of insurgent political participation on post-conflict democracy?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>- What are some domestic obstacles to peacekeeping, reconstruction, and justice? How do conflict-affected groups draw boundaries between retraumatization and accountability in the absence of state processes?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In developing answers to these questions, the course will deepen students&rsquo; grasp of the different methods that have been used to study conflict, including ethnography, interviews, regression analysis, and survey experiments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Assignments for the course include weekly classroom posts that identify, assess, and integrate arguments based on the week&rsquo;s readings; an in-class midterm assignment, and a final paper.

Foreign Policy Analysis is much more granular because it examines how policymakers decide. As you will learn, actual decision-making is always messier than what grand theories imply. So, from the grand and the &lsquo;macro&rsquo;, we look on the domestic, state, organizational, and personal levels to understand the multitude of factors that affect a country&rsquo;s foreign policy. In order to do this, we make use of various conceptual lenses: theories of rational choice and alternatives to rational choice, individual/group psychology, emotions, culture/identity, and more. In a way, this course will be an exercise in unlearning IR Theory 101.</p>\n\n<p>So, what are the kind of questions that this class will help you think about? Perhaps questions such as &lsquo;Why did the United States respond to the discovery of Soviet missiles in Cuba with a blockade rather than any other possible response?&rsquo;, &lsquo;Why do state leaders sometimes choose policy options with a high risk of failure while less risky options are available?&rsquo;, &lsquo;How did domestic politics impact US-Iranian relations in the early twenty-first century?&rsquo;, &lsquo;How did Nehru&rsquo;s experience of colonial subjugation shape his ideas of non-alignment?&rsquo;, &lsquo;What are the effects of social media on foreign policy?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Can small states be successful in their foreign policy and, if yes, under what conditions?&rsquo;. These are just some examples. The main objective of the course is to introduce you to the many approaches one can take when trying to understand, explain, and analyse foreign policy processes and decision-making.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>A basic understanding of Foreign Policy Analysis and how it converges with and diverges from systemic IR theory.</p>\n\n<p>Familiarity with several theories and core concepts of Foreign Policy Analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Ability to distinguish between different levels of analysis and how each of these entails varying approaches to research.</p>\n\n<p>Ability to question rhetorical justifications for prominent foreign policy decisions that often are not the real reason why such decisions are made.</p>\n\n<p>Ability to apply a Foreign Policy Analysis theoretical framework to a case of choice or to write a critique of such a theoretical framework.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>See attached syllabus.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Lecture and Discussion Sessions participation 15%</p>\n\n<p>Memo assignments 15%</p>\n\n<p>Mid-term exam 30%</p>\n\n<p>End-term essay 40%</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>See attached syllabus.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/256d68cc-3529-4e77-8f48-c07c8f1bb16b.pdf' download='Syllabus_FPA Spring 2024.pdf'>Syllabus_FPA Spring 2024.pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

This course aims to open up knowledge practices from sites and positions that are usually not immediately addressed or recognized in mainstream debates in International Relations. International Relations is also enacted and performed through various mediums such as<strong> popular culture, films, literature, music, art, paintings, museums, sports, etc.</strong> The course will enable the students to look at the two-way relationship between aesthetics and international politics &minus; both shaping and structuring the other. It will also underline that aesthetics and its deployments are deeply political acts and not value-neutral. The course will simultaneously familiarise students with conceptual and methodological tools drawn from different fields to understand the art and craft of international politics by other means. In doing so it explores what counter imaginations may exist to conventional disciplinary understandings regarding <strong>statehood, citizenship, borders and boundaries, violence, development, human rights, social change a</strong>nd subjectivity as well as what new political horizons and alternative modes of scholarly engagement might unfold from them. &nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

Starting with theories of power in international politics, the course will examine ideas of strategy and strategic coercion, military power (continental, maritime and air), nuclear strategy and proliferation, insurgency and terrorism, and the impact of frontier technologies (cyber, drones and artificial intelligence) on security. The course will also focus on the institutional dimensions of strategy, including civil-military relations and intelligence analysis.</p>\n\n<p>This course is designed as an advanced undergraduate seminar. The materials, format and grading rubric for this course have been designed to enable you to engage closely with the readings and&nbsp;participate thoughtfully in discussions.&nbsp;This is a demanding and reading intensive course that aims at making&nbsp;you&nbsp;engage with a range of texts on strategy and security. You may&nbsp;have up to 100-pages a week to read. It is imperative therefore to stay on top of the readings and assignments for each week.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Any 2000-level IR course is a prerequisite for this course.</strong> This cannot be waived.</p>\n\n<p>Students are expected to read all the assigned material for the week prior to the class.&nbsp;These will be uploaded on Google Classroom.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reading List</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Week 1: Power and Security</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Required Reading</em></p>\n\n<p>Steven Lukes, Power: A Radical View, pp. 14-29.</p>\n\n<p>Lawrence Freedman, &ldquo;Strategic Studies and the Problem of Power&rdquo; in Thomas Mahnken and Joseph Maiolo (eds), Strategic Studies: A Reader (London: Routledge, 2008), pp. 22-33.</p>\n\n<p>Paul Bracken, &ldquo;Net Assessment: A Practical Guide&rdquo;, Parameters (Spring 2002), pp. 90-100.</p>\n\n<p><em>Recommended Reading</em></p>\n\n<p>Ken Booth and Nicholas Wheeler, &ldquo;Uncertainty&rdquo; in Paul Williams (ed), Security Studies: An Introduction (London: Routledge, 2008), pp. 133-151.</p>\n\n<p>David Baldwin, &ldquo;The Concept of Security&rdquo;, Review of International Studies 23:1 (1997), pp. 5-26.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week 2: Strategy I: Introduction and Frameworks</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Required Reading</em></p>\n\n<p>Stephen Biddle, &ldquo;Strategy in War,&rdquo; Political Science and Politics, 40:3 (2007).</p>\n\n<p>Lawrence Freedman &amp; Srinath Raghavan, &ldquo;Coercion&rdquo; in Williams (ed), Security Studies.</p>\n\n<p>Edward Luttwak, &ldquo;The Logic of Strategy&rdquo;, pp. 1-15.</p>\n\n<p><em>Recommended Reading</em></p>\n\n<p>Hew Strachan, &ldquo;The Lost Meaning of Strategy&rdquo;, pp. 421-36.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week 3: Strategy II: The Challenges of Strategy</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Required Reading</em></p>\n\n<p>Richard Betts, &ldquo;Is Strategy an Illusion?&rdquo; pp. 5-50.</p>\n\n<p>Robert Jervis, Perception and Misperception, chap. 3</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week 4: Land Power</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Required Reading</em></p>\n\n<p>Clausewitz, On War, Bk I chs. 1-2.</p>\n\n<p>Halford Mackinder, &ldquo;The Geographic Pivot of History&rdquo;, pp. 298-321.</p>\n\n<p>Stephen Biddle, Military Power: Explaining Victory and Defeat in Modern Battle, chapter 3, pp. 28-51.</p>\n\n<p><em>Recommended Reading</em></p>\n\n<p>Clausewitz, On War, Bk II chs. 1-5</p>\n\n<p>Geoffrey Sloan, &ldquo;The Heartland Theory Then and Now&rdquo;, pp. 15-38.</p>\n\n<p>Lawrence Freedman, &ldquo;A Theory of Battle or a Theory of War&rdquo;, Journal of Strategic Studies 28:3 (2005), pp. 425-35.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week 5: Maritime Power</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Required Reading</em></p>\n\n<p>Geoffrey Till, Seapower: A Guide for the Twenty First Century, chs. 3, 6.</p>\n\n<p>Julian Corbett, &ldquo;Some Principles of Maritime Strategy&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Michael Beckley, &ldquo;The Emerging Military Balance in East Asia&rdquo;, pp. 78-119.</p>\n\n<p><em>Recommended Reading</em></p>\n\n<p>Paul Kennedy, &ldquo;Mahan vs Mackinder: Two Interpretations of British Sea Power&rdquo;, pp. 43-85.</p>\n\n<p>Barry R.

The introductory concepts (that we will study in this course) are easy to understand, but are powerful and apply in many contexts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The applications to various fields are too numerous to mention. Lets&nbsp; just say that the modern world would not be so modern without the application of linear algebra, &nbsp;nor would&nbsp;our understanding of the universe would be where it is now.&nbsp;And neither would mathematics be as developed if all kinds of mathematical objects are not studied using linear algebra. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>However, the course is mostly mathematical. Applications will be to understand some mathematical objects.The subject unfolds slowly over the semester.&nbsp;As you work through the semester, you learn how to extend your intuition of&nbsp;two and&nbsp;three dimensions to work in an n-dimensional space. At the same time, as the title of the main textbook reflects,&nbsp; this course may be regarded as an&nbsp;introduction to abstract mathematics. So you learn how to apply logical arguments to prove statements.</p>\n\n<p>Its a busy course requiring a lot of effort and enthusiasm. You have to be young and energetic and want&nbsp;to learn a lot very quickly. But why&nbsp;am I saying this?&nbsp;You are Ashoka students.&nbsp;Of course you are young and energetic and want to learn a lot very quickly!</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The syllabus in the course handbook is as follows.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong>&nbsp;Real&nbsp;vector spaces, subspaces, spanning sets, basis sets, dimension of a vector space.&nbsp; Solution of a system of linear equations.&nbsp;Row space and column space of a matrix, rank of a matrix, elementary row and column operations of a matrix.&nbsp;Inversion of square matrices, rank factorization of a matrix.&nbsp;Properties of determinants.&nbsp;Linear transformations, range and null space of a linear transformation, rank-nullity theorem.&nbsp;Matrix representation of a linear transformation.&nbsp;Inner product spaces, normed linear spaces, examples of different normed linear spaces, orthonormal basis sets.&nbsp;Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, characteristic polynomials.&nbsp;Spectral theorem for real symmetric matrices.&nbsp;Singular value decompositions.</p>\n\n<p>We are likely to do all the above for vector spaces over Complex numbers. The proof of the Spectral theorem is&nbsp;a little easier for this.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Text book:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Isaiah Lankham, Bruno Nachtergaele and Anne Schilling,&nbsp;Linear Algebra - As an Introduction to Abstract Mathematics, Free online text available from:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~anne/linear_algebra/</p>\n\n<p>We will cover most of the book including Appendix A.</p>\n\n<p>The course material is roughly from this book, but I will&nbsp;deviate a bit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional References.</strong></p>\n\n<p>You may find the following books helpful as supplementary reading in case something is not clear from the textbook.</p>\n\n<p>1.

I may hand out some class notes too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Computer algebra system.</strong></p>\n\n<p>We will make extensive use of the computer algebra system SAGE. In the real world, Linear Algebra is done using many different numerical packages. However, we use a symbolic algebra package. SAGE&nbsp;is available at:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sagemath.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.sagemath.org</a></p>\n\n<p>Please install it before coming to class.

How do they intersect, integrate and separate? Moving from individual introspection towards an ensemble practice, the course also offers students the opportunity to consider bodies and voices in terms of the figurative and corporeal - the physical body as the instrument of the voice, the voice as the spirited expression of the body; the body as a site of rupture, protest, celebration; the voice as a playground for discovery and connection. Through games, improvisation, textual analysis, devising, case studies, physical strengthening and conditioning, breathwork, and choral singing, the coursework seeks to immerse students in the paradoxes of performance.

Logic is concerned with truth; in learning it, we learn to evaluate how well our thoughts and arguments are tied to truth. We will study several articial&nbsp;formal languages, especially rst-order propositional and predicate logic, as well as modal and higher-order logic. We will think about their relation to the&nbsp;natural language&nbsp;of English, and to the world, as it is independent of all our speech.</p>\n\n<p>This is a demanding course, covering a good deal of challenging technical ground. It is still an introductory course, intended primarily to prepare philosophers for work across that subject. It is not an advanced course, exploring the field of logic for its own sake, in the manner of an advanced metaphysics course. But as an introductory logic course, it is more advanced than most (including, for instance, the logic course offered by the excellent department at Leeds, in Britain&rsquo;s prestigious Russell Group). Some of the topics covered towards the end are at the edge of active research. You will have to work hard, and you may well feel yourself struggling at times.

Economics asks questions about the activities of production and exchange; history asks questions about what the past was like, and why; physics asks questions about what are the fundamental forces operating in the universe. Inevitably, these disciplines all must wrestle, implicitly or explictly (usually both), with the question of how to set about addressing their central questions. What matters more, the patient accumulation of facts in&nbsp;libraries and laboraties , or simple models and elegant formulas? Do we know how the Song silk industry worked, or the rates at which things fall on exoplanets,&nbsp;or can we only make plausible guesses?&nbsp;Can we even say when one answer is better than another at all?&nbsp; Similar questions&nbsp; arise also in ordinary life: if your friend has let you down before, can you depend on his word now? Press such thoughts&nbsp;far&nbsp;enough, and you end up doing epistemology.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Unsurprisngly, epistemology has always been central to philosophy, being a major preoccupation of Plato and Aristotle, as well as of the Nyāya&nbsp;here in India, and&nbsp;indeed the Neo-Confucians of the Song. This course will teach epistemology as an active area of research within the analytic tradition of philosophy, picking up the story in 1963, when Edmund Gettier launched the quest to analyse the concept of knowledge into more fundamental terms. What is knowledge? How can our beliefs be justified? How do knowledge, justification, and belief interrelate? What should&nbsp;we say to the sceptic, who denies that&nbsp;we have any knowledge at all? These are some of the problems pursued in the discipline today, and this course will take us through them, including some of the very latest twists and turns.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Here is a rough plan</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 1-3: Gettier to Williamson</p>\n\n<p>This part of the course will introduce the topic, and cover the main themes of analytic epistemology. Per tradition, we will start with Edmund Gettier&#39;s case that knowledge is not justified, true, belief, and the different attempts to define knowledge that followed; explore in detail the broad debate between internalism and externalism in epistemology; and explore the idea that knowledge should be taken as s starting to explain the rest of epistemology, rather than being defined in supposedly more basic terms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 3-6: The Pramana</p>\n\n<p>Next we will look at some putative ways of knowing in more detail, such as perception, inference, and testimony.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 6-9: Foudations and Scepticism</p>\n\n<p>After this, we will consider questions about the structure of justification, such as whether there are a few self-justifying beliefs on which all others depend, or whether our beliefs are collectively&nbsp;justified by their internal coherence, as well as examining the the challenge of scepticism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 10 on: Contemporary Debates</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we will look at some recent developments in epistemology, such as the new evil demon problem, the relation between knowledge and belief, and Jennifer Nagel&#39;s work on intuitive vs&nbsp;reflective assessments of knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>By the end of this course, you will be familiar with current debates in epistemology. You will be able to explain different theories of knowledge, including their main strengths and weaknesses. You will understand the challenge of scepticism, and the possible responses to it. You will be able to articulate and defend your own views about knowledge and right belief.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>You should read Jennifer Nagel&#39;s&nbsp;Knowledge: A Very Short Introduction.&nbsp;It&#39;s available as a cheap paperback, and I will try to source a PDF. More detailed reading lists for the different topics will be shared later.&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>There will be weekly quizzes on the material, accounting for 20% of the grade, a sit down midterm testing understanding and analysis accounting for 30% of the grade, and a final research paper accounting for 40% of the grade. The final 10% will be for participation.&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Poor attendance will count against your participation grade, and particularly poor attendance may incur a further penalty.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

As a matter of fact, works of art have been created from the prehistoric era to modern times. In every period of history, while the general public enjoys their aesthetic experiences, a large number of people are busy creating works of art. Contemporary art is exemplified in diverse forms such as literature, painting, sculpture, architecture, music, theatre, etc. This unique status has made art the subject of inquiry by various disciplines such as history, sociology, literary criticism, etc. Philosophers, however, from antiquity to the contemporary era, tried to raise and answer a set of the most fundamental queries about art. This prolonged philosophical inquiry has led to the formation of what nowadays is called &quot;philosophy of art&quot; or &quot;aesthetics.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>In this introductory course, we will review some prominent philosophical views about art and try to answer questions like: what is the nature of art? Is it possible to provide a suitable definition for art, in its general sense? What are the artistic characteristics of a work or activity? How can we understand the artistic value of a work? What is the relationship between art and ethics? What are the most important contemporary theories about art and what are the strengths and weaknesses of each? In order to find the best answers, we will discuss the ideas of some great philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Hume, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, and Derrida.</p>\n\n<p>Having a philosophical approach, this course does not require any professional pre-knowledge of any specific art forms.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The aim of this course is to:</p>\n\n<p>Articulate an overview of philosophical issues related to the course topic</p>\n\n<p>Practice critical analysis and evaluation of philosophical theories of art</p>\n\n<p>Engage in reasoned and charitable philosophical discourse about the relevant issues with the class community</p>\n\n<p>Become familiar with the methodology of philosophy</p>\n\n<p>Develop expository writing skills.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Main Readings: (detailed will be announced in the syllabus)</p>\n\n<p>Carroll, No&euml;l.

Pacifists, on the other hand, claim that many or all forms of state sponsored or political violence are unjustified. We will examine prominent positions on the justification of violence, and will consider whether specific forms of political violence, such as genocide, are distinctively morally problematic.

Students will be trained to think and write self-critically, rigorously, and re-enact philosophical dialogues in class on the following themes from TLP:</p>\n\n<p>*the world of facts and why there must be simple&nbsp;objects&nbsp;and atomic&nbsp;states of affairs( TLP:1--2.02); *form and&nbsp;content of&nbsp;objects&nbsp;and the concept of&nbsp;logical&nbsp;space&nbsp;( TLP 2.0124--2.063);&nbsp;*the&nbsp;picture theory of meaning&nbsp;and &nbsp;thoughts&nbsp;as&nbsp;logical&nbsp;pictures&nbsp;( TLP 2.1--3.1432);&nbsp;*names,&nbsp;propositions,&nbsp;saying&nbsp;versus&nbsp;showing,;*how&nbsp;negation&nbsp;and other&nbsp;logical constants&nbsp;&nbsp;mean (but do not represent);&nbsp;*the sentences of logic as&nbsp;tautologies,&nbsp;*and nature of&nbsp;philosophy as the activity of logical clarification of thoughts; *the concepts of the senseless and the&nbsp;unsayable ( TLP: 3.203--4.112);&nbsp;*the&nbsp;subject&nbsp;/ first person&nbsp;that thinks;&nbsp;limits of language and thought;&nbsp;*meaning of&nbsp;life and&nbsp;the Mystical; *how&nbsp;ethics and&nbsp;aesthetics are one.&nbsp;From BBB: imagination, the object of thought, and how one&nbsp;can think what is not the case&nbsp;etc. Topics we shall read, write and discuss from PI:&nbsp;*rejection of the &quot;Augustinian&quot;=referential theory of meaning and Logical&nbsp;Atomism of the&nbsp;Tractatus. (PI: 1---63);&nbsp;*language-games and&nbsp;&ldquo;meaning =&nbsp;use&rdquo;&nbsp;(PI:43&mdash;137)&nbsp;;*following a&nbsp;rule and the Nature of Understanding ( PI: 138--242); *sensation and the&nbsp;argument against the possibility of a&nbsp;private&nbsp;language( PI:243--427);*wish,&nbsp;expectation and&nbsp;will (PI: 437--494,&nbsp;feelings, bodily sensations, seeing and&nbsp;seeing-as&nbsp;(PI: Pt II, Sections viii--xi); *concept&nbsp;formation and&nbsp;memory ( PI:&nbsp;PtII, Section xii--xiii);*nature of&nbsp;philosophy;&nbsp;the&nbsp;place of&nbsp;moral,&nbsp;aesthetic and&nbsp;religious&nbsp;values in Wittgenstein&#39;s&nbsp;thought.&nbsp;An Introductory Logic class is not a pre-requisite but would surely help.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

In this course, we will explore Aristotle&rsquo;s own conception of virtue ethics alongside contemporary positions. These theories converge and diverge in interesting and philosophically revealing ways. Some contemporary views are, like Aristotle&rsquo;s, eudaimonist, identifying a flourishing, well-lived life as the overarching goal of the virtuous person, and identifying individual virtues as states constitutive of that goal. Exemplarist virtue theories instead identify virtues as states that produce motivations that match those of the wholly good person. Still other virtue theories identify virtues as character states that enable us to see the world less egoistically, to see it &lsquo;on its own terms&rsquo;. We will explore questions about the plausibility of Aristotle&rsquo;s virtue ethics and a range of contemporary virtue theories, and we will consider arguments against these theories from critics of virtue ethics.</p>\n</div></div>",

Of this field, Einstein said, &ldquo; It is the only physical theory of universal content, which I am convinced, that within the framework of applicability of its basic concepts will never be overthrown.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Given this unambiguous indication as to its importance, also as a foundation for other fields, this course will develop the ideas and intuition appropriate to thinking about thermodynamics and making calculations in thermodynamics.</p>\n\n<p>The approach of this course is first grounded in intuition regarding the need for conservation laws, such as of energy, expanded to include internal modes that are not accessible at the macro level. The difference between microscopic and macroscopic degrees of freedom will be emphasized, and the problem of thermodynamics presented at understanding how behaviour in equilibrium at the&nbsp; macroscopic scale requires that we think of the impact of the microscopic degrees of freedom that must enter the description. We will discuss the idea of entropy in detail, taking a postulational approach to thermodynamics and then showing how all of what we take for granted in thermal equilibrium can be derived from a small number of basic principles.</p>\n\n<p>Topics that this course will cover include: the history of thermodynamic thought, fundamental relations in the energetic and entropic representations, the first, second and third law of thermodynamics,&nbsp; the Gibbs and Euler relations, Legendre transformations and free energies, Maxwell relations, Carnot cycles and their interpretation, useful work and the relation to statistical physics.</p>\n\n<p>The emphasis will be on (a) the development of the right intuition&nbsp; in its historical context (b) the codification of this intuition in terms of the laws of thermodynamics and how to understand them&nbsp;and (c) actual&nbsp;calculations of relevance to real life</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The student will develop a fundamental intuition about thermodynamics that will illuminate its application to statistical physics.

It asks a broad range of questions that are both theoretically and substantially important. What are states and how did they become the primary form of political organization in the world? Why are some states more capable than others? Why are some countries more prosperous than others, is there one or many paths toward economic development? Why is inequality rising across the world? What is ethnicity and nationalism and why is it associated with conflict and violence? What is globalization, and why is it celebrated in the Global South and associated with rising populism in the West? We will integrate theory with case studies from across the world.</p>\n\n<p>As an introductory course, it will also place an equal emphasis on familiarising students with the political science &lsquo;approach&rsquo; to studying politics and society. A thorough understanding of the scientific enquiry will prepare you to expertly read empirical (that is, research that is based on observation) journal articles and books. We will understand the logic of comparing cases to draw inferences in a scientific manner. We will become comfortable with thinking about politics in terms of unit of analysis, independent and dependent variables, and alternative explanations. The course will also explain how political science attempts to reach causality, that is, how evidence is used to make convincing claims that a particular factor &ldquo;causes&rdquo; a phenomenon (state capacity, economic development, civil wars) more significantly than others.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The goals of the course are three-fold. By the end of the course, students should have an overview of some of the major debates in the field of comparative politics. This will prepare students to take advanced courses in political science and other social science departments. Second, the course will reinforce the department&rsquo;s continuous training in analytical thinking. It will bolster students&rsquo; ability to distinguish between different theoretical explanations, evaluate the merit of competing arguments made in the literature, and communicate their arguments clearly in written form. Finally, the course will also augment students&rsquo; intellectual ability to take an informed stand in contemporary political debates and become more consummate readers of news and popular media.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Reading list from the previous iteration of the course.

Political debate often centers around ideals like nationalism, secularism, liberty, justice, constitutionalism, democracy and the like. Some skeptics believe that when politicians appeal to ideals, they always do so self-servingly in the pursuit of power. But even power is a political concept. Understanding political concepts are therefore important for participants in politics &ndash; and all of us are participants in politics as citizens. But understanding political concepts is also important to analyze and explain political events. After all, explanations often involve political concepts like democracy, federalism, the rule of law, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Political theory is the sub-field of political science that critically engages with political concepts and ideas. There are two main approaches to political theory: history of political thought &ndash; studying the development and history of ideas &ndash; and political philosophy &ndash; studying political ideas systematically. Students can meet their political theory requirement through a course in either of the traditions. Introduction to Political Theory focuses on political philosophy, although we will read some historic texts both from Europe and India.</p>\n\n<p>The course is divided into four big parts. We begin by studying democracy and constitutionalism. Is there a will of the people? Is democracy possible? Is constitutionalism a compromise with democracy? Ideas of constitutionalism are often associated with liberalism and secularism. The second part discusses these ideas. What is the basis for human rights? How should we understand secularism? Do liberty and equality conflict? The last question points towards another domain of politics: social justice. In the third part we look more closely at social justice. We look at questions of caste, class, and gender. Some of these questions are often framed as identity politics. One form of identity is that of shared citizenship. Another threat that binds us together is our shared humanity. How should we think of these two connections, nationalism and cosmopolitanism? How should we do political theory in light of this?</p>\n</div></div>",

It is motivated by a set of perplexing observations about armed conflict in India. First, India&rsquo;s response to civil wars (or insurgencies) involves both massive levels of violence to coerce communities into obedience, and extensive distribution of development funds to induce loyalty. Do these strategies complement or contradict each other? What is the long-term effect of these strategies?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Second, India has an impressive track record in defeating armed groups, but it struggles to resolve conflicts. Regions like Kashmir, Nagaland, and Manipur continue to remain affected by low levels of violence. Why?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Third, India&rsquo;s governing institutions do not fritter away. Generally, we do not notice a complete breakdown of law and order that often leads to large-scale migration in other countries. Instead, civil administration remains robust and even expands during civil wars. How does India succeed in avoiding the World Bank&rsquo;s conflict-trap hypothesis, wherein armed conflict depletes state&rsquo;s capacity and creates conditions for future conflict?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, even as India limits fundamental rights (such as right to assembly, right to speech and opinion) through the Armed Forces Special Powers Act time and again, it is eager to resume electoral democracy. Why? Why not just continue with the President&rsquo;s Rule?&nbsp;From Kashmir to Nagaland, elections in conflict zones register exceptionally high participation. Yet, contrary to the convention that voting is an indicator of legitimacy, surveys and ethnographies show that communities affected by conflict do not positively associate with Indian identity, or at the very least, their identification with Indian nationalism is tenuous. How do democratic institutions operate in conflict zones where political rights are limited by the threat of violence by both sides?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To understand these seemingly contradictory observations, one must look beyond the literature on civil war. The course, therefore, is a compliment to Militants or Freedom Fighters? Armed Conflicts in India (familiarity with the civil war literature is not essential to understand content in <em>Nations..</em>) that examines civil wars in India through the lens of major works&nbsp;of civil wars.&nbsp;Nation and State-Making in India&rsquo;s Borders will use canonical works of nationalism, state formation, organised violence, and the politics of development as pillars to guide our search for answers to these vexing questions. Equipped with the knowledge of theory, we will study detailed case studies and collectively discuss the most convincing explanations for patterns of nation and state-making in India&rsquo;s contested borderlands.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The goals of the course are three-fold. By the end of the course, students should have an overview of some of the major debates in the political science of nation and state-making (or state-formation). We will collectively grapple with understanding linkages between state and nation-making with civil wars. In doing so, the course will also familiarise students with major civil wars (or &lsquo;insurgencies&rsquo;) in India through detailed case studies. Finally, the course will reinforce the department&rsquo;s continuous training in analytical thinking. It will bolster students&rsquo; ability to distinguish between different theoretical explanations, evaluate the merit of competing arguments made in the literature, and communicate their arguments clearly in written form.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Please see readings from the previous iteration of the course below.

While it is well-established that male bodies make up the vast majority of decision-makers and participants in quotidian electoral politics, the same logic applies to contexts affected by conflict and war. Conventionally, male bodies are considered to be at the forefront of decision-making about whether to go to war, and on the frontlines of said wars as fighters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the last few decades, however, these constructions of masculinity and femininity have come to be questioned. Instead, the understanding that gender affects the way in which we see and make sense of the world around us &ndash;&nbsp;and that men and women experience and affect wartime and electoral dynamics differently &ndash; has come front and center. In the same spirit, we will focus on the role of women in political decision-making and participation; their role both as perpetrators of violence as combatants (and terrorists), as victims and as survivors of male-victimizing atrocities; the militarization of gendered bodies and the impact of gender-based violence in armed conflict.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we will reflect on the gendered aspects of women&rsquo;s restructuring of economies in male absence, their resistance to political violence, and their role in peacekeeping and rebuilding societies after war. As we cover each theme, we will pay particular attention to what feminists have described as intersectionality and the continuum of violence, from the &ldquo;private&rdquo; to the &ldquo;public&rdquo; sphere, from the militarization of everyday living to overt violent conflict. In addition, we will pay attention to whether different approaches to tackling gender inequality in South Asian contexts have been effective.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Assignments for the course include weekly discussion posts, an in-class midterm assignment and a final paper analyzing a conflict or electoral event through a gendered lens. Additionally, students will be assessed on their preparation for the week&rsquo;s class through their discussion of assigned readings and their in-class presentations.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

We will engage with contemporary theories and responses to the global condition of the rise of religion under conditions of modernity and colonialism. This course has two main sections: Part 1&nbsp;is a conceptual and theoretical exploration of debates on religion, modernity and secularity in contemporary political thought, where the Euro-centrism of canonical sociological theories&nbsp;are examined, questioned and challenged; Part 2 looks at various responses to the global condition of the rise and relevance of religion in its relationship to modernity and secularity in countries such as India, Turkey, Egypt, and South Africa.</p>\n\n<p>A core objective of this lecture course is to bring meta-theorization and area studies together to highlight how current debates emerging from the experiences of the non-Western world challenge the Eurocentrism of concepts and theories of religion, modernity and secularity. We will not only study the reception of so-called &lsquo;Western&rsquo; concepts like modernity and secularity in non-Western societies but also understand how they underwent change as they were re-interpreted or rejected in new environments. Thus, we will put canonical theories under critical scrutiny to understand the plurality and contested nature of what is considered to be &ldquo;religion&rdquo; or &ldquo;secular&rdquo; or &ldquo;modern&rdquo;. The course has a rigorous theoretical basis, and students will be familiarized with the current state-of-the-art debates on religion, modernity, secularism, and secularization. The course has a regional focus &ndash; the post-colonial states of India, Turkey, Egypt and South Africa, and a disciplinary breadth that draws on a wealth of interdisciplinary perspectives, such as&nbsp;Political Science, Philosophy, Sociology, History, and Anthropology.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Upon completion of the course students will be able to:</p>\n\n<p>i) Demonstrate their ability to engage analytically and critically with conceptions&nbsp;of religion, modernity and secularity, and their global impact.</p>\n\n<p>ii) Demonstrate an analytical understanding of the varied impact of modernity, colonialism, and capitalism in South Asia and Africa and their lasting consequences in today&rsquo;s modern states in the region.</p>\n\n<p>iii) Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of contemporary society and politics in South Asia and Africa.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>TBA</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Exam and Requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p>Class participation (Attendance + Participation)&nbsp;is going to count for 20% of your final grade.

Today&rsquo;s strongmen, such as Trump, Modi, Bolsonaro, Erdoğan, and Orb&aacute;n, demonstrate the rising popularity of populist leadership around the world. This has resulted in a significant rise in the number of scholars studying populism in the recent years, and it is now considered as one of the most contentious issues in contemporary political science. Whether it is the rise and popularity of right-wing nationalism in countries such as India, Israel, Italy or&nbsp;Turkey, or the&nbsp;turn to &quot;democratic authoritarianism&quot; in several constitutional democracies in the world today, or the role of social media as decisive in electoral politics in linking the leader to the masses, populism is seen as a central concept to understand all these contemporary challenges. In order to understand the concept and the political practice of populism, we not only need to examine it both in contemporary times and in history, but also the different forms it has assumed in societies as diverse as Hungary, India, the UK, the Philippines, Brazil, Turkey, the United States of America etc. These varied experiences with populism have also resulted in a diversity of approaches to study this phenomenon. This course will introduce students to influential theories of populism as well as empirical experiences of populism in countries such as India, the United States of America, as well as countries in Latin America and Europe. Analysing populism in various countries will help ground theoretical discussions to the empirical realities of populist politics. The syllabus is thus divided in two parts: in Part &ndash; I we will study the key approaches and theoretical debates on populism; in Part &ndash; II we will study specific case-studies of populism by focussing on countries with a long history and/or recent experience of populism. Throughout the semester, students will be familiarized with the key approaches and theoretical debates on populism, as well as its empirical manifestations in various countries, all the while tracing the conceptual changes and challenges to this concept in its relation to democracy, nationalism and media.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Readings: TBA</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Exam and Requirements</p>\n\n<p>Class participation (attendance + participation) is going to count for 20% of your final grade.

Understanding the basic ideas and arguments of this&nbsp;theory shall equip students with a powerful&nbsp;lens with which to make sense of the proliferating forms of drama in today&#39;s world.&nbsp;The first half of the course is devoted to a close reading of the mythological tale of the origin of drama as provided in the Nāṭyaśāstra, the foundational text of Indian aesthetics. We shall read this tale, moreover, through Abhinavagupta&#39;s famous commentary (Abhinavabhārati). In the second half of the course, we&nbsp;shall then turn to consider in detail the various views of rasa. Here we shall focus on the philosophical problem of the nature of aesthetic relish. Throughout the course, we shall keep an eye on what rasa theory can teach us about politics.

The idea of the course is that many challenges for society and the practice of social science requires the input of multiple disciplines. We shall look at three broad areas: democracy, decisions, and development.</p>\n\n<p>In discussing democracy, we shall ask questions like the following: How do we justify democracy? What kind of democracy should India aspire to be? Given that the chances that your vote will be decisive are miniscule, is it rational to vote? If not, why should one vote and why do people continue to vote? What can results from social choice theory tell us about democracy?</p>\n\n<p>Under the heading of decisions, we shall ask questions related to rationality, rational choice theory, and scientific methodology. Does rational choice theory assume an egoistic homo economicus? How can we square rational choice theory with observations of human irrationality and human altruism? Has expected utility theory, on which microeconomics rests, been falsified? What is the purpose of false assumptions in economics and political science?</p>\n\n<p>In discussing development, we shall ask questions like the following: What is development? Why are some countries poor and others rich? Does this matter for policy purposes? Should we engage in evidence-based policy? What are the methodological and ethical concerns with evidence-based policy?</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The course requires familiarity or a willingness to catch up in all three disciplines: political science, philosophy, and economics - in particular rational choice theory and philosophical reasoning.</p>\n </div></div>",

Understanding psychology as an empirical science will be our starting point. Without rigorous standards for examining human behaviour, psychology would be little more than intuition, opinion, whim or belief. A large part of this course will be devoted to a critical analysis of things you might have already learned in psychology &ndash; some of which might, in fact, be classic misconceptions, in other words &ldquo;myths&rdquo;&hellip; Waiting for us to be explored and find out!&nbsp;<br />\nWe will parallel some of what students are learning in Psychology-1001 but will focus on exploring psychology as a science, including aspects of how to study questions of interest, critical thinking, and analysis of general findings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Structure of the Course</strong><br />\nThis course introduces the scientific discipline of psychology and familiarises the student with basic concepts within it. We look at how researchers and practitioners conduct their work and the various challenges, myths, misunderstandings and misconceptions that the discipline often has to grapple with. First and foremost, this is not a class composed only of lectures. We will devote class time to discussions, demonstrations and in-class presentations, which will add to your appreciation of the application of scientific psychological knowledge in our lives (: Psychology is fun :) However fun it can be, you will need to put in a considerable amount of work. Please come to class with a mindful, interested, curious &amp; courageous mindset, prepared to ask your questions and ready to respond to mine and discuss: I very much look forward to healthy lively discussions in class, as a whole but also in small groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\nPlease note, that this is only the second time I am taking this course, therefore and as in all my courses, there will be a fair amount of flexibility in the course timing as well as in the shaping &ldquo;the course&rdquo; of the course according to your interests, especially in the small group presentations part during the second half of the course!</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Discussion Sections</strong><br />\nWe will be holding discussion sections during the course of the semester to help you review course material and gain further understanding about the application of the concepts covered in class.

These cannot be interpreted meaningfully until one understands and appreciates how the data came about and what can be properly inferred from the data. In this course, we will focus on quantitative methodology. This course is for students who know the basics of statistical analyses.&nbsp;The aim is to develop a trained eye for sound methodology to better evaluate other scientists&rsquo; research, as well as their own. Students will also learn about planning, ethical conduct, and reporting of findings from a survey and experimental study. Along with some of the most widely-used quantitative methods in psychology (e.g., surveys and experiments), students will also understand how these methods are different from alternative methodologies (i.e., qualitative methods, mixed methods).<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Understand various quantitative methods that psychologists use to investigate research questions.</li>\n\t<li>Plan, design, and conduct a psychometrically-sound survey; formulate hypotheses, test them, analyze the results, interpret them</li>\n\t<li>Write report of a survey study to effectively communicate your results</li>\n\t<li>Plan, design, and conduct an experimental study; formulate hypotheses, design and conduct an experiment to test the hypotheses, analyze the results, interpret them</li>\n\t<li>Write report of an experimental study to effectively communicate your results</li>\n\t<li>Understand alternative methodologies available for researchers (qualitative and mixed-method) and when to use them</li>\n\t<li>Grasp, analyze, and critique academics research papers in psychology</li>\n\t<li>Become literate consumers of scientific information.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Pass in Statistics and Research Methodology I, or equivalent modules in math, economics, or political science.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Required materials</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Shaughnessy J.

A rough set of topics is provided in the syllabus, but we can explore really any other system that people are interested in. Every week, one class will involve teaching, and the other will involve discussion and presentations. In the second class, students take turns contributing to the collective understanding of the field by presenting individually selected readings, based on your own interest.&nbsp; Then we will collectively discuss advances in each field, relying on looking up fresh primary research papers together.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The goal of this class is for students to explore various topics in neuroscience that give one a sense of the possible framework of computation through electrical signaling by wet, messy, living systems. The introduction to neuroscience course should have already given you all a sense of how single neurons perform basic computations of addition and subtraction and how elementary circuits might perform more complicated computations. We will explore how these multi neuron circuits work in this course not through textbook material or conventional teaching, but rather through reading primary scientific material.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Grading is equally divided between assignments and presentation - one assignment, one presentation, and one multimedia submission (format of your choice).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Your participation in class or even by email will count towards the remaining 10%.

Following an overview of the anatomy of the human brain, we will then look into the neural processes underlying cognitive functions including sensory cognition, memory, attention, language and music, reward and decision making, consciousness and time. Along the way, we will learn about the methodologies used to study these functions: neuropsychological work in patient populations (e.g. stroke, degenerative diseases) to brain imaging at the macro- and microscopic level (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging, MRI;&nbsp; electro/magnetoencephalography, M/EEG) and brain stimulation techniques (e.g. transcranial magnetic stimulation, TMS; or deep brain stimulation, DBS) and<br />\ncomputational modelling and brain-computer interfacing.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The course will in part follow the text book &ldquo;Cognitive Neuroscience&rdquo;, by world-renowned<br />\nresearchers Michael Gazzaniga et al.

In addition, the course will heavily draw on scientific<br />\nresearch articles (presented by the instructor as well as by the students), which will range from<br />\nseminal &ldquo;classics&rdquo; to hot-off-the-press ones, whereby the final list of papers presented will be<br />\ndetermined by the students&rsquo; specific choices.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Recommended prerequisite:<br />\nIntroduction to Neuroscience.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>About half of the course is taken up by lectures and presentations given by the instructor, whilst the<br />\nother half is taken up by student presentations. The course will familiarize you not only with the<br />\ntopics of the course, including a general and specific knowledge on classical as well as cutting-edge<br />\nresearch findings, but also give you insights with how the world of research works and provide<br />\nvaluable training and practice in presenting research papers in the safe environment of peers. In both<br />\nthe lectures and presentations, interactive discussions based on questions, curiosity and critical<br />\nthinking are highly encouraged. Your input into these discussions is welcome in any and all forms,<br />\nwhichever suits you and the occasion best (raising your hand &amp;amp; voice, chat or even email if preferred<br />\nalthough a bit cumbersome and of course not immediate).

The syllabus is designed to familiarize the students with select concepts and ethnographies of the discipline. We will discuss the sociology and anthropology of kinship, social stratification (caste, race, tribe), cities, migration, nationalism, and environment. Rather than treating these as independent concepts, we seek to show their inter-relation with other social phenomena. For example, how are notions of family and kinship intertwined with science and technology studies; what is the connection between migration and urban transformations, how does one critically study the relation between environment and tourism etc. By doing this, the course demonstrates how the sociological approach explores and finds relations and connections between people, places, and objects. The objective of this course is to develop students&rsquo; appreciation of concepts and categories and their evolution and innovation. This course will also demonstrate to students how theory, ethnography and critical thinking can be integrated. Course materials will include examples from India as well as other parts of the world, and will offer a representative overview and not exhaustive coverage of all topics and perspectives existing in the discipline.

Recent years have seen an increased frequency of disasters globally. From mega events such as tsunamis, cyclones, earthquakes and deep water oil spills to &ldquo;slow disasters&rdquo; like air pollution, soil erosion, desertification, epidemics, and sea level rise, disasters have become ubiquitous. Climate change has made matters worse, producing greater vulnerability, particularly in the Global South, and deepening the ruts of social differences and inequity. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>How do we re-conceptualize risk, disaster, and vulnerability in the Anthropocene? What would an anthropological understanding of disaster look like? In what ways is the (capitalist) state implicated in the production of hazardscapes? How might a decolonial approach to disaster look like? These are but some of the many issues this course aims to grapple with. Drawing on an interdisciplinary scholarship, and a number of iconic case studies from around the world, this course will allow students to gain a critical perspective on disaster and vulnerability.

This course will discuss national and territorial borders as well as symbolic, cultural and bodily borders and borders of the mind. It will focus on populations who cross borders, or live deterritorialised existences, and how their actions defy strictly political ideas of the border. Territorial borders can spread their influence beyond their immediate vicinity through material forms such as check posts or through unequal citizenship laws. Belonging adds another element to this course, for it explores how people relate to the particular geography or society within whose borders they live or are forced to cross during their lifetime.</p>\n\n<p>This course will also explore the conceptual tangle that often results between terms such as borders, boundaries, frontiers, and margins, which seem interchangeable with each other. Whereas borders are understood to be the physical limits of nation-states, and frontiers as porous, flexible zones, boundaries may be symbolic, referring to divides between classes, genders, races, religions or languages. But these are contested categories and their meanings often overlap. People may accept political borders on the surface but morally and practically, transgress them in their everyday life and livelihood activities. Studying borders encourage us not to remain trapped in the search for fixed definitions but to move beyond to understand how they appear and evolve and are crossed and remade. The readings include ethnographies, fiction, social theory and literary essays in order to show the significance of borders in the contemporary world.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>(1) Attendance and class participation = 10 points<br />\n(2) Mid-semester assignment = 25 points (10 pages, double spaced) The mid-semester assignment will be a test of application.

So much so that one often wonders if and to what extent anthropology&nbsp;is&nbsp;method? This course explores the relationships between anthropology and ethnography and those between question and method in the making of the discipline. Indeed, in some ways, the course could also have been named Anthropology&#39;s Questions. Here are some other questions we will ask: What might it mean to have an anthropological imagination or an ethnographic sensibility? How are they related? Where does the field of fieldwork begin and end and how does one find it? What is the relationship between a &#39;site&#39; and &#39;sight&#39; in constituting the field? How else does one sense the field? How long does it take to arrive at and exist in the everyday and how does one exit? How does one deal with questions of subjects and objects, subjectivity and objectivity, intimacy and scale, the actual and the virtual, power and privilege, anonymity and representation, originality and authenticity? How does one go about uncovering and establishing relationships in practice? What is the role of comparison in anthropology? What does it mean to move relationally and comparatively in conceptual and empirical terms? What are the different ways in which anthropologists approach &#39;the field&#39; and &#39;the archive&#39;? How does one go about conducting fieldwork and composing an ethnography? What are disciplinary codes and conventions, how are they established, when are they broken? In what ways might the limitations of anthropology&#39;s methods expand our imagination of its very possibilities? &nbsp;Over the semester, this course will attempt to address these and other questions through close reading, discussion and debates on a range of anthropological texts and texts on anthropology and its methods. Students will also complete a series of methodological exercises and assignments, including crafting a short research proposal and paper.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

Water flows through circuits of power, both benefitting and dispossessing many along the way. In South Asia, access to water is also deeply tied up with questions of caste, along with other axes of difference, such as gender and class. The social life of water in South Asia is thus complex and polyvalent that calls for a deeper historical, cultural analysis across scales, something that this course aims to achieve.</p>\n\n<p>Water is life-giving and non-substitutable. More than a decade ago, in July 2010, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution that recognized the right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation as a human right. Yet nearly a billion people in the world still lack access to safe drinking water, and&nbsp;water-related diseases and deaths remain pervasive, particularly in the Global South. At the same time, recent years have witnessed a drastic rise in water grabbing and privatization, as well as mega hydraulic projects, including large dams, waterways, etc., which often create grounds for water-related conflicts and threaten the survival of many.</p>\n\n<p>This course will help students gain an in-depth anthropological and political ecological understanding of water, with a special focus on South Asia. Based on a range of interdisciplinary literature, as well as field trips within Delhi-NCR, the course aims to provide students with a deeper epistemological and ontological grounding on water, water governance, and water justice. &nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

Can this relationship be theorized through classical explanatory models (Marxism, neoliberal capitalist accumulation, political networks of patronage) that are alive to contemporary forms of urban violence? Violence &ndash; a concept and a mode of action &ndash; constantly oscillates between the physical and the structural, the visible and the invisible, the natural and the social, the institutional and the criminal. Likewise, the modern city refers to the physical environment, a &lsquo;way of life&rsquo;, an assemblage of multiple and heterogenous actors, and a historical process. The course will bring these two terms &ndash; violence and city &ndash; together by offering granular ethnographic accounts of the multiple ways in which they overlap, intersect, and refer to each other. In doing so the course will show how a social imaginary of the modern and postcolonial city is built on the constitutive co-presence of collective violence. At the heart of this co-presence are practices of embodiment and dismemberment, subjectivity and the denudation of the subject and a proliferating economy of affect centered around hate, ressentiment and melancholia. Equally, the force of the biopolitical in instituting novel repertoires of violence will be delimited. Of special importance here is the way in which state practices of violence map themselves over the architecture of the city.</p>\n\n<p>We will read a range of ethnographies from Africa to Asia, from the Middle East to Europe and to the Americas. The course is designed for both advanced graduate and postgraduate students. As part of the evaluation process, all students are expected to write a midterm and end term answer of 40 marks each. Every student will also make one seminar presentation (either singly or in a group, depending on the numbers enrolled). The presentations will make up 20% of the evaluation. The reading list is extensive, but we will make a selection depending on student interest.</p>\n\n<p>The course will be organized along the following thematics:</p>\n\n<p>Introduction: the city as a site of non-legitimate domination (Weber: The City; David Harvey: The Urbanization of Capital)</p>\n\n<p>The city and space (Feldman, Sassen, Das)</p>\n\n<p>Architectures of occupation (the case of Palestine and Gaza</p>\n\n<p>The city as siege&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Violence and performance in the city</p>\n\n<p>The city, the state and the illegible</p>\n\n<p>Legal violence and the city</p>\n\n<p>We will make a selection from the readings listed below.</p>\n\n<p>Eyal Weizmann: Hollow Land</p>\n\n<p>Oscar Verkaaik: Militants and Migrants</p>\n\n<p>Veena Das: Mirrors of Violence/ Anthropology at the Margins of the State (article by Pradeep Jeganathan on checkpoints)</p>\n\n<p>Margaret Trawick: Enemy Lines</p>\n\n<p>Ivana Macek: Sarajevo Under Siege</p>\n\n<p>Yael Navaro: The Aftermath of Mass Violence</p>\n\n<p>Adi Ophir, Michael Givoni: The Power of Inclusive Inclusion</p>\n\n<p>Jean and John Comaroff: Law and Disorder in the Postcolony</p>\n\n<p>Thomas Blom Hansen: Expelled from Public Memory</p>\n\n<p>Lieven Ameel: The Routledge Companion to Literary Urban studies</p>\n\n<p>Derek Gregory and Alan Pred: Violent Geographies</p>\n\n<p>Derek Gregory: The Colonial Present</p>\n\n<p>Alan Feldman: Formations of Violence</p>\n\n<p>Begona Aretxaga: States of Terror</p>\n\n<p>Begona Aretxaga: Madness and the Politically Real in Postcolonial Disorders</p>\n\n<p>Hans Bakker: Ayodhya: A Hindu Jerusalem</p>\n\n<p>Saskia Sassen: When a City becomes a Technology of War</p>\n\n<p>Moyukh Chatterjee: Bandh Politics, Crowds, Spectacular Violence</p>\n\n<p>Marcello Svirsky: Agamben and Colonialism</p>\n\n<p>Sudhir Venkatesh: Gang Leader for a day</p>\n\n<p>Tarek Baconi: Stanford Studies in Middle Eastern Islamic societies and cultures</p>\n\n<p>Deepak Mehta: Collective Violence, Public spaces and the Unmaking of Men</p>\n\n<p>Smadar Lavie: The Poetics of Military Occupation</p>\n\n<p>Mark Seltzer: to be specified</p>\n\n<p>Daniel M Goldstein: The Spectacular City: Violence and Performance in Urban Bolivia</p>\n</div></div>",

The study of past and present pandemics affords conceptual models chiselled by philosophers such as Michel Foucault and Slavoj Zizek, on the one hand, and granular fieldwork-based studies drawing on sociological theories of risk society, gender, globalization, disaster capitalism, and more, on the other that invite attention. In a departure from conventional theorising in this course,&nbsp; we will also explore personal accounts of pandemic-related experiences and COVID-19 art that serve as valuable commentary depicting the impact of the pandemic through expressive modes.</p>\n</div></div>",

From trade unions to fan clubs, political opposition parties to angry&nbsp;mobs, getting together gives humans a different force, whether seen as&nbsp;progressive&nbsp;(&quot;activists&quot;) or retrograde (&quot;rioters&quot;). Togetherness gives agentive valence to disparate humans, and it is only through taking humans together that we understand &quot;public opinion&quot; or can follow &quot;the people&#39;s will.&quot; But togetherness also has a dark and dangerous side in which, for instance, &quot;collective justice&quot; might be unconsidered or even murderous. In this course, we examine the possibilities and terrors of the collective.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How do collectives come to know themselves as such &mdash; as citizens of the same country,&nbsp;members of the same ethnic group, or fans of the same television show? How are people defined by others collectively, whether or not they would agree with the characterization? How can these&nbsp;collectives be studied when they span space and time (in the case of diasporic ethnic groups), or&nbsp;exist only ephemerally (in the case of television audiences)? What analytical frameworks allow&nbsp;groups of people to be recognizable as political subjects or dangerous rioters? We will use a&nbsp;variety of theoretical works and primary sources from history, sociology, anthropology, media&nbsp;studies, and political theory to interrogate the limits and possibilities of imagining collective&nbsp;belonging and collective action. We grapple with &lsquo;universalist&rsquo; theories of crowds, publics, and&nbsp;audiences in order to understand their possible application (or mis-application) in specific&nbsp;contexts. Students are encouraged to use their own research contexts as locations for analyzing&nbsp;collective formations. We will examine television reception, public opinion polls, online&nbsp;communities, grassroots political movements, labour strikes, collective violence and other diverse sites of historic and&nbsp;contemporary togetherness on different scales and in different social locations, both in India and abroad.</p>\n</div></div>",

According to geneticists, the major migrations after the arrival of the First Indians 65,000 years ago were all male-driven, men who interbred with First Indian women, mixing the language streams in a characteristic way. This course will thus examine the evidence offered by geneticists, historians, archaeologists, and linguists to track who met whom, when, and how this created new communities in South Asia.</p>\n\n<p>We will examine models of how languages mix, going on to look at different situations in the subcontinent where, over the ages, local elites and &lsquo;little people&rsquo; came to terms in with new power structures which called for adjustments, creating prakrits as well as more radically mixed varieties. This will mean stretching our minds back to imagine how things might have been before the early empires appeared, spreading local prakrits across the north of this land. We will also see how that gave way to the connected web of languages we have today, with the influence of those early prakrits continuing to spread into India like slowly cooling lava. We will then go on to think about English, the newest player in Indian language power structure, and how this links to the other end of the life cycle: Indian languages threatened as their speaker communities move on to new languages.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='https://ams.ashoka.edu.in/UploadFiles/CourseCatalogueFiles/3a1970b4-5a79-4260-8f3e-ebb647132464.docx' download='Lingua Indica--Anthropology.docx'>Lingua Indica--Anthropology.docx</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

This course looks at cities through three thematic lenses: accumulation, order, and identity. It studies cities in relation to the countryside, tracing flows of people and goods that create wealth and poverty. It examines the spatial politics of managing urban populations, from planning to informality. It analyses cities as places where cultural identities &ndash; parochial and progressive &ndash; are formed and defended. It introduces urban studies as a critical area of sociology and anthropology, and as an essential prerequisite for understanding environmental politics.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Course requirements and grading criteria</p>\n\n<p>1.&nbsp; Attendance and class participation (20%)</p>\n\n<p>Students must come to class prepared to discuss the assigned readings and participate actively in class discussions.

The gap between the global North and global South is particularly stark as evidenced by just a few distressing indicators: 1.4 billion people live on less than $1.25 a day; 1.1 billion people have inadequate access to water; 2.6 billion lack basic sanitation; 24,000 children die each day due to poverty.</p>\n\n<p>This seminar examines some of the major theories, paradigms, perspectives, concepts and policies that, over the past 60 years, have attempted to explain, predict or otherwise effect change in the global South, including modernization and dependency theory, neoliberalism, human development, post-development, and feminist contributions to development. The course also surveys some contemporary perspectives on the discourse and practice of development, such as participatory development, the &ldquo;good governance&rdquo; agenda, and the &ldquo;institutional turn.&rdquo; This is a multidisciplinary social science course, drawing on &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; and &ldquo;critical&rdquo; literature from development studies, geography, anthropology, and sociology. We should note at the outset that development is not static, and that it has long been impelled by both practical and theoretical concerns. It has also been and continues to be shaped by geopolitical interests and social scientific trends that are not immediately tied to development. Bearing this in mind, we shall seek to answer the following key questions this semester: What is development? How have our ideas about development, its causes, and its objectives changed over time? Why, after 60 years of development, are so many people still suffering from poverty, economic decline, ill health, political insecurity, repression, and powerlessness? Where should we focus our development efforts in the future?</p>\n\n<p>Goals</p>\n\n<p>This course is intended to survey the major debates that have occurred within development studies over the past 60 years.

Seeking answers to these questions, this course brings in dialogue the works of art with the spaces that such works have come to inhabit in our present world &ndash; museums, art galleries, and other spaces of visual exhibitions. Moving beyond the established trajectories of looking at exhibitions, museums, and gallery spaces as storehouses of masterpieces of Art, or merely as spaces of ordering, classifying, and displaying objects and images, we will look closely at how exhibition practices of museums and public art galleries, constitute the very category &ldquo;Art&rdquo; around a select body of objects and images. Beginning with early modern royal and notable private collections, and cabinet of curiosities across the world, the course will explore the specific moments of the coming into being of public museums and art galleries through fairs, &ldquo;freak shows&rdquo;, and world exhibitions in Europe and across different parts of the world. It will explore how politics of collection, museum acquisition, display, and repatriation are tied with larger questions of colonialism, war, loot, postcolonial nationalist reassertions, and postwar encounters with race and ethnicity. With a specific focus on Asia, the course will map the connected global trajectories of museums, art galleries and memorials as dense narratives of unfolding spatial and temporal complexes. In the process it will highlight the role of the artists, curators, and museum/ gallery visitors in the production of a complex set of dialogues around artistic, and curatorial visions. The course will end by looking at contemporary South Asia, mapping the challenges of redesigning exhibition orders of older museums and art institutions and spread of museum modes of display and viewing, with different intent, in commemorative sites, theme parks, memorials, and new temples. This co-constitution of art and art museums will be addressed during class discussions and during visits (both on site and virtual) to local galleries, museums, theme parks, and temples &ndash; to the Indian Museum, Kolkata (virtual), the National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi (on site), the National Museum, New Delhi (on site,) the National Handloom and Handicrafts Musem, New Delhi, (on site), the Rashtriya Dalit Prerna Sthal, Nodia (on site), the Swaminarayan Akshardham Complex, New Delhi (on site). the British Museum, London (virtual) and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London (virtual).</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>On successful completion of the course, we will be able to: a) Explore the main trends in the development of Art History, Visual Culture and Museum Studies by accessing the critical essential skills. b) Evaluate the approaches of artists, art historians, and curators to the field of visual arts and museum studies c) Explore curatorial practices in the art world d) Develop the interests for a future training in art curatorial programme and critical museum studies.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Modules</p>\n\n<p>Introduction to the Scope and Aims of the Course: Why Museums?

In Latin, it comes from &quot;archivum&quot; or &quot;archium,&quot; while in Greek, it&#39;s related to &quot;arkheion.&quot; This term not only referred to the place where important records were kept but also the people responsible for managing them, the &quot;archons&quot; or citizens.</p>\n\n<p>Archives are like a time capsule, preserving the past. They&#39;re unique to individuals, organisations and specific periods in history, so no two archives are the same. They serve as a reminder of everything we might forget but should always remember. Archives hold a special power because archives act as the keepers of our collective memories, providing a glimpse into the worlds of writers, artists, thinkers and organisations, that helps us understand the different worlds where the materials in the archives come from. They&#39;re like hidden treasure troves for storytelling enthusiasts, creative minds, artists and scholars.</p>\n\n<p>Exploring the Ashoka Archives: The Ashoka Archives is building up to offer an incredible wealth of knowledge, stories, experiences, correspondences, and images. It&#39;s truly astonishing that such an amazing resource is now on campus. As an educational institution, it&#39;s exceptionally vital to emphasize that without an archive, a significant portion of cultural history, can get lost due to various reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Centred around the Ashoka Archives, this course aims to delve into distinctive viewpoints of scholars through active engagement with archives and the materials that pique their individual interests. Scholars will also delve into the dual role of archives, serving as both tools and points of reference for shaping their artistic and storytelling visions. A primary emphasis of the program will be to openly and candidly investigate how archival materials can be harnessed to spark new artistic possibilities. Through art, visual storytelling, graphic narratives, there&rsquo;s an opportunity for the scholars to reinvigorate and re-examine the information available but also to generate new creations and events that can themselves be archived, allowing the scholar artists to contribute their unique voices to the historical record.</p>\n\n<p><u>What this course is about</u></p>\n\n<p>The fundamental concept here is to utilize the Archive as a platform for artistic discussion and intellectual exchange. This will offer not only the institution but also scholars and practitioners a chance to develop fresh, critical, and imaginative methods to engage the public. This engagement will be based on the materials found in the Ashoka Archive. The emphasis lies on both the Archive itself and individual scholars, who will collaboratively produce knowledge, visual narratives, and expertise. The process is as crucial as the final results, ensuring that visual exploration aligns seamlessly with the creation of knowledge and artistic expression.</p>\n\n<p>The course is designed to empower scholars in conjunction with the Archive over a single semester:</p>\n\n<p><u>Creative Documentation</u>: These projects will focus on creating content to enrich the archive&#39;s knowledge repository, ultimately leading to tangible outcomes such as mini-books, zines, and catalogues.</p>\n\n<p><u>Creative Projects</u>: These initiatives aim to support creative expressions that interpret the archive&#39;s collections through visual stories, comics, artwork, and other artistic endeavours.</p>\n\n<p>This approach can help the scholars in negotiating their findings, research and learnings through visual interpretations in multi-disciplinary formats that is much required in today&rsquo;s realm of information &amp; content, where visual storytelling is an alternate and a popular form of information, opinion and communication.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong><u>Learning Objectives</u></strong>: These learning objectives will guide scholars through the course, enabling them to not only delve into the archival materials available but also develop a skill set that combines historical interpretation, visual storytelling, and ethical considerations in presenting interpreted narratives inspired from the archive.</p>\n\n<p><u>Understanding Archives</u>: Define the concept of archives and their significance in preserving historical records. Explain the role of university archives in the history making and the process of documentation within the framework of an academic institution.</p>\n\n<p><u>Research and Selection</u>: Develop the skills to identify and select relevant materials from the university archive. Distinguish between primary and secondary sources and understand the value of primary materials in historical research.</p>\n\n<p><u>Visual Analysis</u>: Learn to critically analyse visual materials, including photographs, documents, and artifacts. Identify key elements of visual analysis, such as authorship, date, context, and significance.</p>\n\n<p><u>Material Context</u>: Gain an understanding of the historical context in which the selected materials were created. Recognize the broader historical events and societal influences that may have shaped the materials.</p>\n\n<p><u>Visual Storytelling</u>: Master the principles of visual storytelling, including design, composition, and narrative. Develop the ability to create visually engaging and informative materials based on historical content. Explore the use of digital tools and design software for creating visual materials. Learn to articulate the stories and insights conveyed through visual interpretation.</p>\n\n<p><u>Ethical Considerations</u>: Explore the ethical considerations when working with historical materials, including issues related to copyright, privacy, and cultural sensitivity. Learn to handle and cite archival materials with integrity and respect for the rights of individuals involved.</p>\n\n<p><u>Interdisciplinary Skills</u>: Encourage interdisciplinary thinking by connecting historical materials with various academic disciplines. Foster the ability to draw insights and connections between archival content and other fields of study.</p>\n\n<p><u>Reflection and Analysis</u>: Encourage critical thinking by reflecting on the impact of visual interpretation on historical understanding. Analyse the choices made during the interpretation process and their implications.</p>\n\n<p><u>Collaboration and Peer Review</u>: Foster collaboration by engaging in peer review and constructive feedback with fellow students. Learn from others&#39; interpretations and perspectives.</p>\n\n<p><u>+ Final Project</u>: the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course to create a final visual interpretation project using materials from the university archive. Present the project to the class, showcasing the historical context, significance, and storytelling elements.</p>\n\n<p><strong><u>Course Modules</u></strong>:&nbsp;The proposed modules aim to provide scholars with valuable skills in archival research, critical analysis, visual design, and storytelling while fostering a deeper connection to their university&#39;s archive and the materials available. The idea would be in exploring from the diversity of materials to create diversity of practice involved in visual interpretations. The core idea here will be to discuss the materials available to create forms and works that can bring new practice-based influences and ideas, their working process and explore the architecture of visual storytelling in these works.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 1-2: Introduction and understanding the University Archive</p>\n\n<p>In this initial module, scholars will be introduced to the concept of university archive. They will gain an understanding of what these archives are, why they are essential for preserving historical records, and how they play a significant role in documenting academic works, arts, historical materials etc.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 2-3: Understanding the Archives &amp; Research Skills and Selection</p>\n\n<p>Scholars will be initiated with practical skills for conducting archival research. They will receive hands-on guidance on searching for materials within the university archive&#39;s catalogue or database. The module will emphasize the importance of reliable sources and the value of primary documents in historical research. Scholars will be encouraged to select a specific topic or theme related to their interest or a particular collection within the archive.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 3-4: Selection of material + Analysing and Placing in Context</p>\n\n<p>In this module, the focus will be on how to critically analyse the materials selected by the scholars. They will delve into key elements of analysis, including authorship, date, context, and significance. Additionally, they will explore historical context, including the important events, and the broader historical backdrop. Scholars will be encouraged to ask probing questions about the materials they&#39;re examining and to uncover the stories and insights they hold. Scholars will also be sensitised how to handle and cite archival materials appropriately, with a strong emphasis on giving credit to the source and respecting the rights and privacy of individuals involved.</p>\n\n<p>Week 5: Presentation of final material selected + their visual ideas</p>\n\n<p>Selection and research of interesting archival material will be followed to process and distill the findings to create the core conceptual idea and be presented in the studio sessions for the benefit of collective brainstorming and discussions. These discussions with fellow classmates will led to an inter-disciplinary ideation and conceptualization, moving closer to shape and sharpen the core project ideas of the scholars. The scholars will also be expected to share the processing of their research findings along with their influences and inspirations.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 6-7: Mastering Visual Storytelling</p>\n\n<p>Moving on from research, the course will now discuss the working process of creating a visual narrative using multiple influences of form and genres. This will include detailed discussions on the various possibilities of the form i.e., different forms that can be explored - doodle narratives, popular comics, mobile based narratives, photo comics, design, layouts, page architecture, typography, sequential storytelling and the work process involved in each, enabling the students to make informed choices in sync with their ideas. Students will explore various tools and software for creating visual materials, and they&#39;ll discuss the strengths and limitations of popular software including open-source alternatives. Practical exercises will be provided to enable students to create engaging and informative visual materials, which may include designing inarratives, zines, or digital outputs.</p>\n\n<p>Week 8: Presentation of a final project draft followed by discussion on similar ideas &amp; influences</p>\n\n<p>The following week the students will be expected to present their ideas and preliminary drafts as scribbles/ sketches with fellow batchmates, followed by open discussions, suggestions and ideation to evolve a clear understanding to flesh out the final narrative. Peer review and discussion will be encouraged to facilitate mutual learning. Each scholar/ project will be further exposed to similar works through display and in-depth discussions on influences and ideas related to the project to lend a visual and storytelling perspective, enabling the practitioner to take one&rsquo;s work further.</p>\n\n<p>Besides creating multiple micro narratives through the semester, finally, the semester will move to its last weeks to create a bigger multi-page graphic narrative.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 9-14: Final completion with a mid-level presentation in week 8.</p>\n\n<p>A mid-level draft presentation will be shared in the studio to display the work in progress after 2 weeks then followed by the final 4 weeks or the end of the semester, ready for display, presentation and production. Studio presence in these weeks will be a must.</p>\n\n<p><u>Output Participation:</u>&nbsp;Though the output will be individual, the process of production will be based on archival research, short studio collaborations and conversations and work-in-progress presentations at regular intervals as discussed above.</p>\n\n<p><strong><u>Course Deliverables</u></strong>: Every student will be expected to develop, produce multiple research-based short visual stories and graphic narratives/ comics.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Prerequisites: Research based on materials available in the Ashoka Archive, writing, basic drawing, basic research photography, working knowledge of design software like Photoshop, Canva, Krita etc.</p>\n\n<p>Preliminary Reading List:</p>\n\n<p>1. &quot;Archives: Principles and Practices&quot; by Laura A.

From being a custodian of art in a museum, the role of the curator has diversified extensively in the past decades to a new dynamic of cultural production and collaboration between the artists and curators. By beginning with the history of curatorial practice and the figure of the curator, this course will offer students an initial grounding on curatorial practices and models globally. It will unpack the challenges and possibilities of art institutions such as private galleries, museums, non-profit organizations, and Biennales. Further, it will investigate with case studies the methods of curating art that does not fit into the neat institutional definitions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In this part-theoretical and part-practical course, the students will also learn hands-on procedures of curating: research, fundraising, management, design, publicity, exhibition making, and producing a publication. With studio exercises and interim collaborations with artists and art institutions in India, the course aims to enable the students to discover their niche in the potentiality offered by the methods of curating.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Modules&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Curating as Memory-making - Introduces the histories of curatorial practice by assessing the role of curating in constituting public memory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Shifting Role of the Curator - Familiarizes the students with the multiple roles and responsibilities of the curator through history.</p>\n\n<p>The Expanded Field of the Curatorial - Unpacks the practices of the curatorial that embrace interdisciplinarity in practice and research moving beyond the formats of exhibition-making.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Curating in Museums - Maps the history of curatorial practice within the space of the museum to understand how it has reconfigured the public role of art.

While photographic images&nbsp;stand&nbsp;for&nbsp;real/truth of an image, ie,&nbsp;&#39;this exists&#39; in a moment in time, it is also a framing device; it is an apparatus that lends itself to&nbsp;re-presentation and reproduction of an image.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While a still image captures the fleeting momentary aspect of a world we live in, it represents this moment in specific ways. It reproduces this moment, frames it and imbues it with the subjectivity of the photographer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is this aspect of photography that this assignment explores, especially in relation to early photographic folios, albums and other incunabula as Walter Benjamin points out to us.</p>\n\n<p>Note:&nbsp; Sequentiality and Repetition could be utilised to hold certain directorial vision or poetic aspects to the narrative. Also you could utilise&nbsp;the inherent qualities of a photograph- that a photograph&nbsp;manages to capture&nbsp;a fleeting moment of a second (shutter speeds), as well as varying qualities of light (aperture);&nbsp;&nbsp;it captures certain frames that human eye cannot capture, including a point of view where human eye may not be able to reach.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Module 3: Photography and Identities:</p>\n\n<p>Reading:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christopher Pinney&nbsp; (1997) - Camera Indica&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter- Chamber of Dreams</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Susan Sontag&nbsp;&nbsp; (1973)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Photography&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter- On Melancholy</p>\n\n<p>Practice exercise:</p>\n\n<p>Assignment 3: Shifting from the premise of photography as that representing a reality, create a series of images that provide a convincing impression of a construction and framing of a tableau.

We will be looking at the practice of four contemporary artists, including Chitra Ganesh, Nalini Malani, Nikhil Chopra, and Pushpamala N in trying to understand how strands of history, memory, mythology, iconography, ethnography and identity become visible through their image making process.</p>\n\n<p>In thinking of the everyday through the prism of theatrical reality, the course encourages inquiry about how can drawings and the act of drawing itself be a dialogue about&nbsp;provisionality, uncertainty, and change. How do artists and artistic explorations address issues of meaning-making and shared history, politics, and culture?</p>\n\n<p>How does the process of repetition, layering, overlapping, erasure, and incision transform an image, leading to alternative perspectives about how we perceive and engage with the known? How can we tell the same story with a different material and socio-cultural context?</p>\n\n<p>Recognizing the importance of contradictions, ambiguity, and serendipity as integral to processes of meaning-making, students have the flexibility to make interventions that can vary from being poetic, polemic, dramatic, metaphorical, provocative or incisive. You are encouraged to borrow from processes of handmade cinema posters, comics book, experimental theatre, set design, printmaking, photo performance etc.</p>\n\n<p>By taking figures and forms out of their familiar settings and putting them in a &lsquo;fluid&rsquo; and fantastical environment where seemingly unrelated ideas respond to one another, the course encourages students to attempt blurring of boundaries between fiction and reality.</p>\n\n<p>Modules</p>\n\n<p>Module 1: Narrating and re-narrating</p>\n\n<p>Duration-3 weeks</p>\n\n<p>Class exercises will include study of selected Kalighat paintings, Amar Chitra Katha, hand painted posters of early Indian cinema and viewing of works from early 20th century experimental theatre.

What are the forces that shape the lives and practices of individuals referred to in public discourse as craftsmen, or &lsquo;folk &lsquo;and &lsquo;tribal&rsquo; artists in post -colonial India? How much agency do they have over their lives and practice and to what extent are they &lsquo;manipulated&rsquo; by &lsquo;outside&rsquo; mediations? And how do tradition and modernity parley with each other in the shaping of their work and careers? This course is designed to make students actively debate and engage with these issues and beyond, through case studies of practitioners of both material and performative practices. It&nbsp;&nbsp;examines trajectories in artisanal and performative practices from the region of Madhya Pradesh, &nbsp;the recently created state of Chhattisgarh, and the regions of Maharashtra, Bihar and West Bengal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The course will acquaint students with case histories of practitioners, from the ground,&nbsp;&nbsp;to trace trajectories of transformation. Students will engage with questions of caste and community, agency, selfhood, and gender, to understand the shaping of art forms and their contexts. They will be led to look at&nbsp;&nbsp;shifting contexts for the production&nbsp;&nbsp;and reception of art practices, examining&nbsp;&nbsp;the role of the state, museums and institutions, exhibitions and the market in creating binary categories of &lsquo;art&rsquo; verses &lsquo;craft&rsquo;. A key component will be unravelling histories and modes of intervention following developmental or anthropological paradigms in the field.</p>\n\n<p>Discussions will be largely based on films and video recordings from the &lsquo;field&rsquo;, interviews, exhibition catalogues and on- site visits to the crafts museum&nbsp;&nbsp;and art galleries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Areas of discussion include:</p>\n\n<p>Understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;contemporaneity&nbsp;&nbsp;in practices referred to as&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Warli, Gond, and Madhubani&nbsp;art&#39;&nbsp;and in Bengal pata chitra.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Seeking the indigenous in the &lsquo;folk&rsquo; .</p>\n\n<p>Performing identities,&nbsp;&nbsp;of &lsquo;artist &lsquo;and &lsquo;craftsperson&rsquo; in the lives and practice of modernist sculptor Meera Mukherjee and&nbsp;&nbsp;Jaidev Baghel, metal sculptor from Bastar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The role of key museums and institutions in the &lsquo;discovery&rsquo; of art forms and&nbsp;&nbsp;the creation of&nbsp;&nbsp;exhibition paradigms.( Bharat Bhavan, Crafts Museum, Tribal Museum)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The role of interlocutors from art worlds, such as J.&nbsp;&nbsp;Swaminathan, Pupul Jaykar etc and their impact in transforming practices.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><ul>\n\t<li>trace&nbsp;&nbsp;shifts in art practices of marginalised constituencies in post- independence India.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>debate the binaries of &lsquo;art&rsquo; and &lsquo;craft &lsquo; as categories created within different social and institutional contexts.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>debate the nature&nbsp;&nbsp;and extent of agency&nbsp;&nbsp;exercised by creative persons from marginalised communities.</li>\n\t<li>re imagine modes for alternative interventions in art practice.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Course Structure and modules</strong></p>\n\n<p>The course syllabi focuses on the following set of practices and forms from Central&nbsp;India. It follows developments in the lives of practitioners and their practice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Modules</strong></p>\n\n<p>&lsquo;Gond&rsquo; art</p>\n\n<p>In 2001, the artist Jangarh Singh Shyam committed suicide at a Museum in Japan, unable to return home before&nbsp;&nbsp;paintings that had been&nbsp;&nbsp;commissioned by the Museum&nbsp;&nbsp;were completed. He was a Gond Pradhan,&nbsp;&nbsp;from an &lsquo;adivasi &lsquo; community in Central India&rsquo;, famously &lsquo;discovered&rsquo; by the art world in 1981. This module charts his life and art through films, art works and publications and examines the role of played by art world interlocutors in shaping his life and career.&nbsp;Lectures will look at&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Gond art &lsquo; as&nbsp;&nbsp;a tradition that was &lsquo;invented&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;in recent times, and look at individuals who followed Jangarh Singh Shaym to trace trajectories in their practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will also look at&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;primitivism&rsquo; as a phenomenon in 20th&nbsp;century modern art&nbsp;&nbsp;to unpack ideologies that informed the discovery of &lsquo;adivasi&rsquo; artists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Rajwar clay sculpture&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Valorised as a woman sculptor whose art was born of loneliness, Sona Bai&rsquo;s life changed completely after her discovery by teams from Bharat Bhavan. Her art which was made from local clay found in&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarguja in Chhattisgarh&nbsp;&nbsp;shaped into sculptures and screens, began to&nbsp;&nbsp;adorn museums and exhibition spaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did this shift from a domestic space&nbsp;&nbsp;in the interiors of Chhattisgarh to sites of international exhibition do to her art and how much agency did she have in shaping her life or work? Which markets defined her work&nbsp;&nbsp;as individualistic&nbsp;&nbsp;art practice and which defined it as&nbsp;&nbsp;craft born of women&rsquo;s labour?&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens when her work, which was domestic and therefore private,&nbsp;&nbsp;enters a larger public sphere for staging ethnicities? Students will look at films, exhibition catalogues and in situ installations to understand her art and that of others who followed her.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Gadhwa metal sculpture, Bastar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The module will&nbsp;&nbsp;focus on the transformation of&nbsp;&nbsp;metal sculptures from Bastar, from objects of ritual use to highly sought after objects in the art market.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jaidev Baghel, metal sculptor from Bastar, was able to negotiate a space for himself across markets, moving between art worlds and sites for the marketing of&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;crafts. Students will look at his work and that of the modernist sculptor Meera Mukherjee&nbsp;&nbsp;who apprenticed under him to see how both practices changed through the interaction. They will also examine how the idea of the &lsquo;folk&rsquo; feeds into ideas of authenticity and nationality.</p>\n\n<p>Between ethnography and anthropology&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>How have ethnography and anthropology as disciplines shaped the work of largely urban based individuals and institutions to inform interventions in the field?&nbsp;&nbsp;Students will look at the work of Verrier Elwin, J . Swaminathan, photographer Sunil Janah, culture activist Pupul Jaykar, artists Meera Mukherjee, Navjot Altaf&nbsp;to raise questions about ethics and intentionality. &lsquo;</p>\n\n<p>Performative practices</p>\n\n<p>This module looks at&nbsp;&nbsp;shifts in the performances of the&nbsp;Pandvani, (stories of the Pandavas recited in Chhattisgarh), and the&nbsp;Lorik Chanda&nbsp;, tracing the emergence of&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;professional artists&rsquo; and the shifts from oral to textual sources of storytelling. what are emic understadigns of this shift ? Student will also looks at &lsquo;Nacha&rsquo; a form of theatre that became popular in Chhattisgarh in the early years of the twentieth century, examining interventions by Habeeb Tanveer, the modernist theatre director,&nbsp;&nbsp;and the trope of&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;indigenism&rsquo; in modernist art discourse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Subalternity in Chhattisgarh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This module will focus on practices that define subalternity in this region, and their resistance to the culture of upper caste communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these are highly charged performative practices that have, so far,&nbsp;&nbsp;also resisted being co- opted into mainstream culture. One of the most compelling of these are the Ramnamis, a community that perform&nbsp;&nbsp;bhakti and resist upper caste practices by tattooing their bodies with the name of the divine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Readings:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Themes outlined in the readings below will inform discussions on the modules listed above.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Central India: mapping the field&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Gregory, Christopher A. &quot;Chhattisgarh: At the crossroads.&quot;&nbsp;The Modern Anthropology of India.
